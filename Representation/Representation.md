#### Entertainment/Publishing Lawyers

What do entertainment lawyers do?

> Just like Frances Gumm became Judy Garland, and Thomas Mapother III became Tom Cruise, "entertainment law" is actually a more glamorized, fabricated name for contract law, copyright law, intellectual property law, licensing law, litigation, and working really hard just like every other lawyer out there . . . . Entertainment lawyers are merely copyright, contract, or IP lawyers who have clients in the entertainment business, just like sports lawyers have clients in the sports business.

#### Literary Agents

Unlike talent agents, literary agents are not governed by special sections of the New York or California Labor Codes, but as agents they are governed by the common law of agency. In short, the relationship between an author and her agent are whatever is contained in the contract, usually signed at the commencement of their relationship.

##### *Peter Lampack Agency, Inc. v. Grimes*

###### 2010 NY Slip Op 51749 - NY: Supreme Court 2010

The Peter Lampack Agency (PLA, a literary agency) sued Martha Grimes, an author of literary and commercial fiction, for unpaid commissions allegedly due and owing under contracts negotiated by PLA on behalf of Grimes.

PLA had acted as literary agent for Grimes for twelve years and had procured publishing agreements for works authored by Grimes. Those works were published, and Grimes received
over $12 million dollars from the publication and domestic and
international sale of her novels. 

Among the contracts PLA procured for Grimes was a four-book publishing agreement entered into by Grimes, Penguin, and Viking-Penguin in 2005. 

That 2005 agreement contained an option clause, similar to option clauses found in many publishing agreements, in effect giving the publisher the right of "first look" at the author's next work:

> [T]he Author hereby grants to the Publisher the exclusive right and option to publish . . . her next book-length work of fiction . . . . The Publisher shall have a period of thirty (30) days after receipt by the Publisher of the notification from the Author or her agent of the Author's desire to commence negotiation concerning such next book-length work of fiction within which to notify the Author whether it desires to publish such work and to negotiate the terms and conditions of such publication.

The 2005 Penguin agreement also contained an agency commission clause, providing that:

> The Author hereby appoints [PLA] irrevocably as the Agent in all matters pertaining to or arising from this Agreement . . . . Such Agent is hereby fully empowered to act on behalf of the Author in all matters in any way arising out of this Agreement . . . . All sums of money due the Author under this Agreement shall be paid to and in the name of said Agent . . . . The Author does also irrevocably assign and transfer to [PLA], as an agency coupled with an interest, and [PLA] shall retain a sum equal to fifteen percent (15%) of all gross monies due and payable to the account of the Author under this Agreement.

In or about May 2007, Grimes notified PLA that she would no longer be using PLA as her
literary agent and retained a new representative.

On February 4, 2009, in accordance with the terms of the Option on Next Work clause, Grimes' counsel sent a letter to Penguin enclosing a manuscript of "The Black Cat." 

On February 27, 2009, Penguin made an oral proposal to Grimes' counsel and the agreement for "The Black Cat" was finalized on August 20, 2009. 

On November 18, 2009, PLA filed a complaint against Grimes and her publishers alleging breach of contract among other claims. PLA alleged that the publishing agreement for "The Black Cat" arose out of the Option on Next Work clause and that Grimes violated the terms of the 2005 Penguin/Viking-Penguin Agreement by refusing to account to PLA and refusing to pay PLA the sums due for "The Black Cat."

PLA also alleged that the defendants acted in bad faith and breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the 2005 Penguin/Viking-Penguin Agreement.

PLA also contended that Grimes owed it commissions on various extensions of publishing agreements that PLA had procured for Grimes over the years. 

Defendant Martha Grimes moved to dismiss arguing that under the 2005
Penguin/Viking-Penguin Agreement, PLA was not entitled to commission for
"The Black Cat" because: 

1. PLA's agency is not coupled with an interest and PLA's agency was revoked in May 2007; 

2. the Option on Next Work clause is an unenforceable "agreement to agree"; and 

3. the publishing agreement for "The Black Cat" does not arise out of the
Option on Next Work clause.

The trial court ruled in favor of author Martha Grimes on all counts holding:

> The only part of the 2005 Penguin/Viking-Penguin Agreement that entitles
PLA to commission is the commission provision. The Option on Next Work
clause does not provide for PLA to receive commission for publishing
agreements arising out of the clause. 

Instead, the court looked at the commission provision and found that PLA was not entitled to commissions on "The Black Cat" or any other publishing agreements or extensions of prior publishing agreements entered into after Grimes had notified PLA that it was no longer her literary agent. 

On the question of whether the commission clause found in the Penguin 2005 publishing agreements constituted an "agency with an interest," the court had this to say:

> It is the general rule that an agency for no definite term is revocable
at will. [] However, when an agency authority is coupled with an interest,
the agency is irrevocable. [] An agency is coupled with an interest where, as a part of the
arrangement with the principal, the agent receives title to all or part
of the subject matter of the agency.

Citing the Restatement 2nd of Agency 2d Agency § 63 and New York law, the court said:

> To make the power irrevocable, there must be an interest
in the subject of the agency itself, and not a mere interest in the
result of the execution of the authority . . . . . Words alone are not
enough to establish an agency coupled with an interest.

The court found that 2005 Penguin commission provision granted PLA a 15% commission in
the proceeds from its sale of rights in Grimes' literary works and not
an interest in those literary works themselves. The mere fact that the
commission provision "appoints PLA irrevocably" as an agent was not
enough to create an agency coupled with an interest.

Because PLA did not have a property interest in Grimes' literary works, its agency was revocable, and it was revoked in May 2007. 

#### Hollywood Representation

Usually involves one or more of the following:

-   Talent Agent
-   Personal Manager
-   Business Manager
-   Entertainment Lawyer

At what point in the careers of various artists do they need each of
these representatives? When does it make sense for an author of crime
novels to consult an attorney? What can an aspiring screenwriter do
while waiting to attract the attention of a talent agent?

Talent agent versus talent manager: What are the differences? Are agents
and managers both regulated? Do they have different legal obligations to
talent.

Commissions: How do reps charge for their services?

Agents and managers also engage the services of foreign sub-agents with whom they sometimes split commissions.

#### New York’s Employment Agent Regulation

New York regulates "theatrical employment" agencies under its general business laws where section 171 defines a "theatrical employment agency" as: 

> any person . . . who procures or attempts to procure employment or engagements for circus, vaudeville, the variety field, the legitimate theater, motion pictures, radio, television, phonograph recordings, transcriptions, opera, concert, ballet, modeling or other entertainments or exhibitions or performances, *but such terms does not include the business of managing such entertainments, exhibitions or performances, or the artists or attractions constituting the same, where such business only incidentally involves the seeking of employment therefore.*

[New York General Business - Article 11 - § 171 Definitions](http://law.onecle.com/new-york/general-business/GBS0171_171.html)

#### California Talent Agencies Act

###### &sect;&sect; 1700.23-1700.47 of the California Labor Code

In California, talent agents and talent agencies are regulated by the Talent Agencies Act (TAA), which is part of the [California Labor Code](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.html/lab_table_of_contents.html).  

[TAA Section 1700.4](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=lab&group=01001-02000&file=1700-1700.4) carefully defines its terms:

> "Talent agency" means a person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring, offering, promising, or attempting to procure employment or engagements for an artist or artists, except that the activities of procuring, offering, or promising to procure recording contracts for an artist or artists shall not of itself subject a person or corporation to regulation and licensing under this chapter. Talent agencies may, in addition, counsel or direct artists in the development of their professional careers.

So, under the TAA, a talent agent is:

> A person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring, offering, promising, or attempting to procure employment for artist or artists.

Put simply agents find artists work. By contrast, managers are supposed to simply "manage" their clients careers. If managers start "procuring, offering, promising or attempting to procure employment" for their clients, then they are engaging in activities regulated by the statute, and they are acting like unlicensed agents. If their clients complain to the Labor Commissioner, the managers may forgeit any commissions earned from unlawfully acting like agents.

No better illustration of this than *Wachs v. Curry*.

##### *Wachs v. Curry,* (Cal.Ct.App.2d 1993).

* [*Wachs v. Curry,*][wachs] 16 Cal.Rptr.2d 496 (Cal.Ct.App.2d 1993).

Actor and talk-show host [Arsenio Hall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenio_Hall) sued his former manager, Robert Wachs (a lawyer) of X Corporation, accusing Wachs of trying to "procure empoyment" for Arsenio even though manager Wachs was not licensed as an agent under the California Talent Agency Act. 

The California Labor Commissioner ruled that Wachs had been involved in the
occupation of procuring employment for Hall. Commissioner ordered that X Management reimburse Hall for $2.2 million in fees they had been paid for Hall's role in *The Arsenio Hall
Show* and screen credit they received as well.

Manager Robert Wachs sued the Labor Commissioner and made the following arguments that the Talent Agencies Act (TAA) is unconstitutional:

* The California legislature has "no rational basis" for exempting the recording industry from the provisions of the TAA. 
* The TAA is unconstitutionally VAGUE. How does a manager know when he or she is *procuring* employment?

The court ruled in favor of Arsenio. The court said that the provision exempting the procurement of recording contracts from the Act was rational and should be retained because entertainers
in the recording industry tend to have *personal managers* conduct
many of the negotiations for recording contracts – *they conduct a
wide array of activities.* And in the recording industry, the ambiguities and
intangibles of the acitivites performed by a personal manager create
problems of attempting to license or otherwise regulate them

The court ruled in favor of Arsenio on the vagueness claim also. A statute will not
be held void for uncertainty if any reasonable and practical
construction can be given its language.  It will be upheld if its terms
may be made reasonably certain by reference to other definable sources. The Talent Agencies Act focuses on the employment procurement function and most people in the industry know what procuring employment means.

RULE: If the agent's employment procurement function constitutes a significant part
of the agent's business as a whole, *then he/she is subject to the
licensing requirement of the Act, EVEN IF procurement of employment was
ONLY an incidental part of the agent's overall duties*

Effect of *Wachs v. Curry*:

1. Upheld constitutionality of the Talent Agencies Act;
2. Limited the scope of the Act by confining the licensing requirement to those for whom the employment procurement function constitutes a significant part of the agent's business as a whole.

##### Music Industry Exception

Notice that California's regulation of agents contains an exception under the TAA for managers working in the music business: 

> . . . except that the activities of procuring, offering, or promising to procure recording contracts for an artist or artists shall not of itself subject a person or corporation to regulation and licensing under this chapter.

Meaning the TAA prohibits managers from procuring, offering, or promising employment for their clients, EXCEPT for managers in the music business. This was a good portion of Manager Wachs argument, i.e., that this exemption for managers in the music business made no sense.

But the *Wachs* court explained the music-manager exception this way:

> A recording contract is an employment contract of a different nature from those in common usage in the industry involving personal services. The purpose of the contract is to produce a permanent and repayable showcase of the talents of the artist. In the recording industry, many successful artists retain personal managers to act as their intermediaries, and negotiations for a recording contract are commonly conducted by a personal manager, not a talent agent. Personal managers frequently contribute financial support for the living and business expenses of entertainers. They may act as a conduit between the artist and the recording company, offering suggestions about the use of the artist or the level of effort which the recording company is expending on behalf of the artist . . . . However, the problems of attempting to license or otherwise regulate this activity arise from the ambiguities, intangibles and imprecisions of the activity . . . . The majority of the Commission concluded that the industry would be best served by resolving these ambiguities on the side of preserving the exemption of this activity from the requirements of licensure." . . . . On the commission's recommendation, the exemption for those who procure recording contracts became permanent. 

> [*Wachs v. Curry,*](http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar_case?case=5228204368502171794) )Cal.Ct.App. 1993).

Many Hollywood talent managers don't buy this distinction and the regulations remain extremely controversial. *See, e.g.:*
