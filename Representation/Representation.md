### Talent Representatives

#### Entertainment/Publishing Lawyers

What do entertainment lawyers do?

> Just like Frances Gumm became Judy Garland, and Thomas Mapother III became Tom Cruise, "entertainment law" is actually a more glamorized, fabricated name for contract law, copyright law, intellectual property law, licensing law, litigation, and working really hard just like every other lawyer out there . . . . Entertainment lawyers are merely copyright, contract, or IP lawyers who have clients in the entertainment business, just like sports lawyers have clients in the sports business.

#### Literary Agents

Unlike talent agents, literary agents are not governed by special sections of the New York or California Labor Codes, but as agents they are governed by the common law of agency. In short, the relationship between an author and her agent are whatever is contained in the contract, usually signed at the commencement of their relationship.

##### *Peter Lampack Agency, Inc. v. Grimes*

###### 2010 NY Slip Op 51749 - NY: Supreme Court 2010

The Peter Lampack Agency (PLA, a literary agency) sued Martha Grimes, an author of literary and commercial fiction, for unpaid commissions allegedly due and owing under contracts negotiated by PLA on behalf of Grimes.

PLA had acted as literary agent for Grimes for twelve years and had procured publishing agreements for works authored by Grimes. Those works were published, and Grimes received
over $12 million dollars from the publication and domestic and
international sale of her novels. 

Among the contracts PLA procured for Grimes was a four-book publishing agreement entered into by Grimes, Penguin, and Viking-Penguin in 2005. 

That 2005 agreement contained an option clause, similar to option clauses found in many publishing agreements, in effect giving the publisher the right of "first look" at the author's next work:

> [T]he Author hereby grants to the Publisher the exclusive right and option to publish . . . her next book-length work of fiction . . . . The Publisher shall have a period of thirty (30) days after receipt by the Publisher of the notification from the Author or her agent of the Author's desire to commence negotiation concerning such next book-length work of fiction within which to notify the Author whether it desires to publish such work and to negotiate the terms and conditions of such publication.

The 2005 Penguin agreement also contained an agency commission clause, providing that:

> The Author hereby appoints [PLA] irrevocably as the Agent in all matters pertaining to or arising from this Agreement . . . . Such Agent is hereby fully empowered to act on behalf of the Author in all matters in any way arising out of this Agreement . . . . All sums of money due the Author under this Agreement shall be paid to and in the name of said Agent . . . . The Author does also irrevocably assign and transfer to [PLA], as an agency coupled with an interest, and [PLA] shall retain a sum equal to fifteen percent (15%) of all gross monies due and payable to the account of the Author under this Agreement.

In or about May 2007, Grimes notified PLA that she would no longer be using PLA as her
literary agent and retained a new representative.

On February 4, 2009, in accordance with the terms of the Option on Next Work clause, Grimes' counsel sent a letter to Penguin enclosing a manuscript of "The Black Cat." 

On February 27, 2009, Penguin made an oral proposal to Grimes' counsel and the agreement for "The Black Cat" was finalized on August 20, 2009. 

On November 18, 2009, PLA filed a complaint against Grimes and her publishers alleging breach of contract among other claims. PLA alleged that the publishing agreement for "The Black Cat" arose out of the Option on Next Work clause and that Grimes violated the terms of the 2005 Penguin/Viking-Penguin Agreement by refusing to account to PLA and refusing to pay PLA the sums due for "The Black Cat."

PLA also alleged that the defendants acted in bad faith and breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the 2005 Penguin/Viking-Penguin Agreement.

PLA also contended that Grimes owed it commissions on various extensions of publishing agreements that PLA had procured for Grimes over the years. 

Defendant Martha Grimes moved to dismiss arguing that under the 2005
Penguin/Viking-Penguin Agreement, PLA was not entitled to commission for
"The Black Cat" because: 

1. PLA's agency is not coupled with an interest and PLA's agency was revoked in May 2007; 
2. the Option on Next Work clause is an unenforceable "agreement to agree"; and 
3. the publishing agreement for "The Black Cat" does not arise out of the
Option on Next Work clause.

The trial court ruled in favor of author Martha Grimes on all counts holding:

> The only part of the 2005 Penguin/Viking-Penguin Agreement that entitles
PLA to commission is the commission provision. The Option on Next Work
clause does not provide for PLA to receive commission for publishing
agreements arising out of the clause. 

Instead, the court looked at the commission provision and found that PLA was not entitled to commissions on "The Black Cat" or any other publishing agreements or extensions of prior publishing agreements entered into after Grimes had notified PLA that it was no longer her literary agent. 

On the question of whether the commission clause found in the Penguin 2005 publishing agreements constituted an "agency with an interest," the court had this to say:

> It is the general rule that an agency for no definite term is revocable
at will. [] However, when an agency authority is coupled with an interest,
the agency is irrevocable. [] An agency is coupled with an interest where, as a part of the
arrangement with the principal, the agent receives title to all or part
of the subject matter of the agency.

Citing the Restatement 2nd of Agency 2d Agency § 63 and New York law, the court said:

> To make the power irrevocable, there must be an interest
in the subject of the agency itself, and not a mere interest in the
result of the execution of the authority . . . . . Words alone are not
enough to establish an agency coupled with an interest.

The court found that 2005 Penguin commission provision granted PLA a 15% commission in
the proceeds from its sale of rights in Grimes' literary works and not
an interest in those literary works themselves. The mere fact that the
commission provision "appoints PLA irrevocably" as an agent was not
enough to create an agency coupled with an interest.

Because PLA did not have a property interest in Grimes' literary works, its agency was revocable, and it was revoked in May 2007. 

#### Hollywood Representation

Usually involves one or more of the following:

-   Talent Agent
-   Personal Manager
-   Business Manager
-   Entertainment Lawyer

At what point in the careers of various artists do they need each of
these representatives? When does it make sense for an author of crime
novels to consult an attorney? What can an aspiring screenwriter do
while waiting to attract the attention of a talent agent?

Talent agent versus talent manager: What are the differences? Are agents
and managers both regulated? Do they have different legal obligations to
talent.

Commissions: How do reps charge for their services?

Agents and managers also engage the services of foreign sub-agents with whom they sometimes split commissions.

#### New York’s Employment Agent Regulation

New York regulates "theatrical employment" agencies under its general business laws where section 171 defines a "theatrical employment agency" as: 

> any person . . . who procures or attempts to procure employment or engagements for circus, vaudeville, the variety field, the legitimate theater, motion pictures, radio, television, phonograph recordings, transcriptions, opera, concert, ballet, modeling or other entertainments or exhibitions or performances, *but such terms does not include the business of managing such entertainments, exhibitions or performances, or the artists or attractions constituting the same, where such business only incidentally involves the seeking of employment therefore.*

[New York General Business - Article 11 - § 171 Definitions](http://law.onecle.com/new-york/general-business/GBS0171_171.html)

#### California Talent Agencies Act

###### &sect;&sect; 1700.23-1700.47 of the California Labor Code

In California, talent agents and talent agencies are regulated by the Talent Agencies Act (TAA), which is part of the [California Labor Code](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.html/lab_table_of_contents.html).  

[TAA Section 1700.4](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=lab&group=01001-02000&file=1700-1700.4) carefully defines its terms:

> "Talent agency" means a person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring, offering, promising, or attempting to procure employment or engagements for an artist or artists, except that the activities of procuring, offering, or promising to procure recording contracts for an artist or artists shall not of itself subject a person or corporation to regulation and licensing under this chapter. Talent agencies may, in addition, counsel or direct artists in the development of their professional careers.

So, under the TAA, a talent agent is:

> A person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring, offering, promising, or attempting to procure employment for artist or artists.

Put simply agents find artists work. By contrast, managers are supposed to simply "manage" their clients careers. If managers start "procuring, offering, promising or attempting to procure employment" for their clients, then they are engaging in activities regulated by the statute, and they are acting like unlicensed agents. If their clients complain to the Labor Commissioner, the managers may forgeit any commissions earned from unlawfully acting like agents.

No better illustration of this than *Wachs v. Curry*.

##### *Wachs v. Curry,* (Cal.Ct.App.2d 1993).

* [*Wachs v. Curry,*][wachs] 16 Cal.Rptr.2d 496 (Cal.Ct.App.2d 1993).

Actor and talk-show host [Arsenio Hall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenio_Hall) sued his former manager, Robert Wachs (a lawyer) of X Corporation, accusing Wachs of trying to "procure empoyment" for Arsenio even though manager Wachs was not licensed as an agent under the California Talent Agency Act. 

The California Labor Commissioner ruled that Wachs had been involved in the
occupation of procuring employment for Hall. Commissioner ordered that X Management reimburse Hall for $2.2 million in fees they had been paid for Hall's role in *The Arsenio Hall
Show* and screen credit they received as well.

Manager Robert Wachs sued the Labor Commissioner and made the following arguments that the Talent Agencies Act (TAA) is unconstitutional:

* The California legislature has "no rational basis" for exempting the recording industry from the provisions of the TAA. 
* The TAA is unconstitutionally VAGUE. How does a manager know when he or she is *procuring* employment?

The court ruled in favor of Arsenio. The court said that the provision exempting the procurement of recording contracts from the Act was rational and should be retained because entertainers
in the recording industry tend to have *personal managers* conduct
many of the negotiations for recording contracts – *they conduct a
wide array of activities.* And in the recording industry, the ambiguities and
intangibles of the acitivites performed by a personal manager create
problems of attempting to license or otherwise regulate them

The court ruled in favor of Arsenio on the vagueness claim also. A statute will not
be held void for uncertainty if any reasonable and practical
construction can be given its language.  It will be upheld if its terms
may be made reasonably certain by reference to other definable sources. The Talent Agencies Act focuses on the employment procurement function and most people in the industry know what procuring employment means.

RULE: If the agent's employment procurement function constitutes a significant part
of the agent's business as a whole, *then he/she is subject to the
licensing requirement of the Act, EVEN IF procurement of employment was
ONLY an incidental part of the agent's overall duties*

Effect of *Wachs v. Curry*:

1. Upheld constitutionality of the Talent Agencies Act;
2. Limited the scope of the Act by confining the licensing requirement to those for whom the employment procurement function constitutes a significant part of the agent's business as a whole.

For more information, see: [How to obtain a California Talent Agency License](http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/talent_agency_license.html).

##### Music Industry Exception

Notice that California's regulation of agents contains an exception under the TAA for managers working in the music business: 

> . . . except that the activities of procuring, offering, or promising to procure recording contracts for an artist or artists shall not of itself subject a person or corporation to regulation and licensing under this chapter.

Meaning the TAA prohibits managers from procuring, offering, or promising employment for their clients, EXCEPT for managers in the music business. This was a good portion of Manager Wachs argument, i.e., that this exemption for managers in the music business made no sense.

But the *Wachs* court explained the music-manager exception this way:

> A recording contract is an employment contract of a different nature from those in common usage in the industry involving personal services. The purpose of the contract is to produce a permanent and repayable showcase of the talents of the artist. In the recording industry, many successful artists retain personal managers to act as their intermediaries, and negotiations for a recording contract are commonly conducted by a personal manager, not a talent agent. Personal managers frequently contribute financial support for the living and business expenses of entertainers. They may act as a conduit between the artist and the recording company, offering suggestions about the use of the artist or the level of effort which the recording company is expending on behalf of the artist . . . . However, the problems of attempting to license or otherwise regulate this activity arise from the ambiguities, intangibles and imprecisions of the activity . . . . The majority of the Commission concluded that the industry would be best served by resolving these ambiguities on the side of preserving the exemption of this activity from the requirements of licensure." . . . . On the commission's recommendation, the exemption for those who procure recording contracts became permanent. 

> [*Wachs v. Curry,*](http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar_case?case=5228204368502171794) )Cal.Ct.App. 1993).

Many Hollywood talent managers don't buy this distinction and the regulations remain extremely controversial. *See, e.g.:*

#### Presenter Notes: 

Traditionally, publishers have sold books to stores, with the wholesale price for hardcovers set at fifty per cent of the cover price. 

Authors are paid royalties at a rate of about fifteen per cent of the cover price. 

On a twenty-six-dollar book, the publisher receives thirteen dollars, out of which it pays all the costs of making the book. 

The author gets $3.90 in royalties. Bookstores return about forty per cent of the hardcovers they buy; this accounts for $5.20 per book. 

Another $3 goes to overhead costs and the price of producing and shipping the book—leaving, in the best case, about a dollar of profit per book.

Most charge 15% commission on North American sales, including movie rights, audio rights, book club rights, paperback rights.
In the case of movie rights, this commission is typically split with a Hollywood agent.
Most charge 20% commission on international sales, because usually a sub-agent is involved who takes 10% and your agent takes 10%.

Ask Ben: Mgr or Agent first?

PERSONAL MANAGER helps develop, guide, and enhance the career path of the entertainer, usually only 5-6 clients? 5% – 25%

TALENT AGENT markets the entertainer’s services and procures employment offers and contracts for the client.  Also as deal packagers. 10%;

BUSINESS MANAGER (financial) - collects money, pay bills, manages loan-out, 5%. Talent calls and asks, “Can I afford this?” Good business mgrs teach the client fiscal restraint to weather the inevitable back slope of the career;

History of Hollywood agencies. How they came to be. Pages 775-777. 

Recurring troubles with antitrust and double-charging. “Rather than 10% of their own client’s salaries, the agencies took 10% of the program’s entire budget. 

Attempted ownership of TV programs etc.In later 1950s and early 60s, 

Music Corporation of America (MCA) was the CAA of yesteryear. Eventually Robert Kennedy investigated them for antitrust violations. Why? Scandals (see e.g. Quiz Show. MCA also owned movie studios.

NOTE: So MCA is producing movies and television shows and representing the performers who starred in them. (Will become important later at end of chapter, because Michael Ovitz comes close to doing the same thing in the mid-1990s.)

Michael Ovitz and CAA. HUGE. (pg. 776)(4th) Eventually, Ovitz left CAA and went to Disney for a short stay, then started AMG (Artists Management Group). 

Ovitz had non-compete with CAA. So what does he do? Goes into Management.“Another fundamental reason for the AMG management decision is to circumvent the onerous regulations that have been imposed on talent agents over the last century.” (pg 849 mid)

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

LAWYERS ARE SUPER FIDUCIARIES CLICK 

The cheap tricks a professor will use to wake people up at the end of a long day.

Real estate agents, stock brokers, trustees, executors . . . those are fiduciaries. Lawyers are SUPER fiduciaries. 

Our clients come to us for advice and protection and trust and discretion.

We have to be scrupulously loyal. Your instincts, no matter how good, are not enough. 
The only way I know of to protect yourself and to protect your client is to OBEY the Model Rules. 

## Slide 11

### Title: Model Rule 8.4: Misconduct

#### Body 

It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:
 violate or attempt to violate the Rules . . . 
 commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer;
 engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;
 engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; 
 state or imply an ability to influence improperly a government agency or official  or 
 knowingly assist a judge or judicial officer in conduct that is a violation of applicable rules of judicial conduct or other law.

#### Presenter Notes: 


Even if you aren’t technically practicing law while you are acting as a personal manager in the entertainment business, you may still be subject to the Model Rules of Professional responsibility if you are licensed to practice law in that jurisdiction.

## Slide 12

### Title: Lawyers!

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

PAGE 885 BOUND TO SOME STANDARDS OF LAWYER ETHICS EVEN WHEN NOT ACTING AS A LAWYER

Certain Rules of Professional Conduct are applicable to the inquirer’s conduct notwithstanding the fact that the inquirer is not acting as the incapacitated individual’s counsel. 

Although some Rules apply only if a client-lawyer relationship has been formed, see, e.g., Rules 1.2 (scope, allocation of authority); 1.6 (confidentiality); 1.16, 

others apply to members of the bar regardless of whether they are engaged in professional activities. 

Specifically, D.C. Rules 3.3(a)(1), Candor to the Tribunal 3.3(d), and 8.4(c) “engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.”

govern the inquirer’s conduct, even though he is not functioning as counsel to the incapacitated individual.

Rule 3.3(a)(1), which mandates candor to a tribunal, provides that “a lawyer shall not knowingly . . . make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal.”  Comment [2] to Rule 3.3 provides that, “[t]here may be circumstances where failure to make a disclosure is the equivalent of an affirmative misrepresentation.” Rule 3.3(d) provides in pertinent part that “[a] lawyer who receives information clearly establishing that a fraud has been perpetrated upon the tribunal shall promptly reveal the fraud to the tribunal unless compliance with this duty would require disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6, in which case the lawyer shall promptly call upon the client to rectify the fraud.” [4]

Conflicts? Just another word for contacts?

#### Presenter Notes: 

p 776

In the litigation Billy Joel vs. Alan Grubman on pg 801 SETTLED

Ziffren Law Firm bot 801-top 802 SETTLED

Especially a problem for lawyers who represent studios and talent BOTH.

CAA and Ovitz. So CAA represents all of the talent in Hollywood, while Ovitz is playing a big role in Sony purchasing Columbia Pictures for $3.4 billion and others. Dicey!

Flip side: Conflicts means contacts!

See Ziffren examples on 801-802.

Agents must have no conflicts! California amended TAA to bar agents from referring their artists to firms in which the talent agency has a financial interest (or from which the agent receives a referral fee). THIS IS THE REASON AGENTS ARE SO IMPORTANT

Illegal for agents to have tangible conflicts.

The tougher question is posed by cases where the same agent (or manager or lawyer) has two clients who themselves have conflicting interests. 

Here the law basically controls only those entertainment representatives who are lawyers and thus governed by standards of legal ethics.

#### Presenter Notes: 

Pamela Anderson Lee pg. 777 Lawyers. Who is Michael Blaha? Who is he the lawyer for?

Michael Blaha (entertainment lawyer) formerly represented Pamela Anderson. But Blaha is attorney for Private Movie Company. So Blaha gets to play producer, packager whatever by recommending his client Anderson be put in Hello, She Lied

Anderson has both managers and agents. And it seems underlings were at these meetings.

FIRST MEETING - Anderson is there. Offered $90,000 and shown script. But she objects to gratuitous sex and excessive nudity. Efraim (Private Movie’s Prez) says he will fix the script.

## Slide 17

### Title: Private Movie Co. vs. Pam

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

Second meeting- Anderson knows its happening but does not attend. 
Money now at $200,000. They think they reach a deal, even though Pamela is not there.
Note Nudity provisions: (pg 778 bot).

Blaha wrote to Brody (Anderson’s mgr) “I am pleased we were able to reach an agreement on the main deal points.” pg 779 top) 
Clearly the reps THINK they have a deal.

Whoops, a week later, Anderson says “I’m not appearing in your movie.” Still too much nudity. Oh, and by the way, I’ve been offered $500,000 for Barbed Wire.

Note that two months after rejecting Hello, She Lied, Anderson made Naked Souls, which had vivid and graphic sex scenes: 

Anderson said that while the sex in Naked Souls was integral to its story, Hello, She Lied’s sex scenes were “gratuitous.”

Private Movie sues for $5 million, but can’t convince judge or appeals division that a binding contract had ever been reached.

Material disagreement about nudity? Maybe. Not so important for us.

## Slide 18

### Title: Actual v.  Apparent Authority

#### Body 


Actual authority: Client is bound.
Apparent authority: jurisdictions split on whether client is bound.

#### Presenter Notes: 

FACTS/CONTENTIONS
According to Defendant: Plaintiff movie company claimed that an oral contract to make a movie had been reached through an agent and personal manager who were authorized to negotiate and bind Pamela Anderson Lee. Plaintiff further claimed that Lee breached the contract by refusing to do the project. The plaintiff was The Private Movie Company Inc., a California corporation. Ben Efraim is the owner of the company. The defendants were Pamela Anderson Lee, an individual, and Pamela Anderson Productions Inc., a California corporation.

In October 1994 a script was presented to Pamela Anderson Lee's personal manager, Dennis Brody, by an attorney named Michael Blaha, who at the time was representing Pamela Lee in litigation matters. At that time, unbeknownst to her, Blaha was representing Ben Efraim and The Private Movie Company Inc. in other litigation matters. Pamela Lee expressed interest in the character and a ‘creative meeting‘ was set up, at which time she made it known that she liked the character but did not want to have any simulated sex or extensive nudity in the script or in the movie. It was agreed that the script would be rewritten and she would be provided with the rewritten script.

Thereafter, Dennis Brody and an agent for United Talent Agency named Brandt Joel began negotiating with Michael Blaha and Ben Efraim and allegedly made a deal for Pamela Anderson Lee's services on November 18, 1994. It was not until after this date that Blaha allegedly orally informed Pamela Anderson Lee of his conflict of interest. 

There was never a written conflict waiver from any party. Blaha eventually prepared a long form contract, which contract provided for simulated sex. Blaha never prepared a nudity side letter which had been required by Pamela Anderson Lee's representatives. The Private Movie Company began preproduction. The final script, however, was not furnished to Pamela Anderson Lee until after December 27, 1994. Upon review of the script, she quickly determined that the simulated sex scenes had not changed and she notified her manager that she would not do the project. This lawsuit followed.

Plaintiff alleged that an oral contract had been reached on November 18, 1994 through the agent, Brandt Joel, and the personal manager, Dennis Brody, whom plaintiff claimed were authorized to negotiate and bind Pamela Anderson Lee. Defendants contended that there was no oral contract and that there were always two issues outstanding on the deal, i.e., a nudity side letter and approval of the subsequent script. Defendants also contended that neither Brandt Joel nor Dennis Brody had authority to negotiate or bind defendant Lee. Defendants contended further that Blaha's representation of both parties created a presumption of undue influence which was not overcome and that there were no damages.

Questions For Discussion, pg 784

When we do entertainment law contracts, we’ll see other cases “to enforce a contractual promise expressly made by one party by implying a reciprocal obligation on the other party to perform services as consideration for the promise.” See, e.g., Bonner. Should the same principle be applied here where manager is a lawyer who drafted the agreement?

Note that manager’s professional status as an attorney did not override his other duties as manager and representative. Lots of ethical issues for entertainment lawyers.

What about what the interim appellate court called the “tribute in perpetuity”? Any future earnings of the artist would be “due to the opportunities now procured for him” Do you think such a provision should be interpreted that way and enforced? Compare literary agents.

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

LOAN-OUT (top pg 785)

The question of DURATION of these contracts when the talent wants out.

A 1983 contract says Columbia will act as exclusive agent for Watts. 

In 1985, Watts dissolves his loan-out corporation and term of contract set to end in 1986. WHAT HAPPENS?

Even after contract ends, Columbia continues to book, and Watts continues to pay. Then in 1988, Watts notifies Columbia that he wants to terminate the agreement, but Columbia has already booked 82 more engagements and wants its 15% for those.

Court holds: “An implied-in-fact contract between Watts and Columbia because of their dealings after the end of contract term.”

Common occurrence in the Entertainment world, Court will look at BEHAVIOR of the parties, not letter of contract or even whether a contract is signed.

Questions For Discussion, pg 859

1. Agree with Watts? What could the artist have done to protect himself? Get an agent or manager separate from the lawyer? Redo terms of K so that manager not entitled to monies outside the contract term? Compare literary agents. Probably not doable.

2. Watts highlights the common practice in the entertainment industry of proceeding with performances and payments even though no formal contract has been signed. If the performers waited for formal contracts, the entire industry would grind to a halt.

10% Commission.

#### Presenter Notes: 

787
Raden was to receive 10% commission. No duration.

Laurie and her Mom terminated the agreement in October of 1949. Raden filed suit for unpaid commissions. 

Raden not licensed agent. He stated that he counseled and advised her and took her to several locations to educate her, not to find work.

Funny catch 22. Laurie and her Mom are complaining that he didn’t find them work. And Raden can’t say that he DID find them work, because then he’d have to be licensed. 

Note, the term “artist’s manager” at of 789 (4th) confusing because this is under the Artist Managers Act (AMA) in 1943, so manager is synonymous with agent, here.

### Title: Raden v. Laurie

#### Body 

Summary Judgment in Laurie’s favor.
On appeal, court goes for Raden.
“Since Raden was employed only to counsel and advise . . . in matters not related to obtaining engagements for her, he was not acting as a [talent agency] as defined by the Act.”

#### Presenter Notes: 

Page 787
Note: It’s a summary judgment motion. 

Entered in favor of Laurie. Raden appealed.

Appellate court rejected Laurie’s argument that the act of seeking employment, rather than the contract provision, triggered the licensing requirement of the AMA. The court reasoned that an unlicensed individual’s procurement activities in seeking employment will trigger the licensing provisions only if the contract is found to be a sham, designed to conceal the true nature of the agreement between the parties and to “evade the law.”

Weiler: “It would seem clear that his duties were intentionally limited to the rendition of services which would not require his being licensed as an artist’s manager.” (pg 862 mid)

### Title: Wachs v. Curry (1993)

#### Body 

Sues his former manager, 
Robert Wachs (a lawyer!) 
of X Management,
alleging that the company 
had acted as an unlicensed agent.

#### Presenter Notes: 

Page 792

Following the decision, X Management (Wachs) sued James Curry (Labor Commissioner) saying Talent Agency Act is unconstitutional. 

Contract recited that Hall had not retained X Management as a talent agent and that the firm had not promised to obtain employment. 

But from 1987-1990, the firm gets all kinds of employment for Arsenio Hall (mid page 792).

STOP HERE. Don’t read next paragraph. Look at the list. You’ve got representatives who are finding you that kind of work. Do you care if there managers or agents? No, just keep doing whatever you are doing! 

Note, just their 15% commission translates to $2.6 million!

BEFORE TURNING PAGE: Why not just get a talent agent’s license? What’s the big deal? (Question is on page 800 bot)

Okay, now turn the page and find out why Arsenio gets mad. The relationship broke down in 1990, when Hall discovered that Wachs and Lipsky were not only getting screen credit as Production Executives on The Arsenio Hall Show, but they were personally being paid $5,000 a week for this role.

Remedy is a return of all commissions earned during the limitations period. (You have to file suit within a year!) $2.1 million! So, now Wachs sues and says: There’s no rational basis for saying I can’t procure employment but managers of musicians can procure recording contracts!

## Slide 35

### Title: Wachs v. Curry (1993)

#### Body 

  Robert Wachs sues and says Talent Agencies Act is unconstitutional:
 No rational basis for exempting recording industry;
  Vagueness.

#### Presenter Notes: 

So, now Wachs sues and says: There’s no rational basis for saying I can’t procure employment but managers of musicians can procure recording contracts! 

Bot 793(4th). Recording contracts are different. The purpose is to “produce a permanent and repayable showcase of the talents of the artist.” What’s so different about that?

Wachs also tries to argue that the meaning of “procure” is VAGUE. It’s not defined in the Act. 

Managers don’t know what kind of conduct requires you to get a license (pg 794 mid)

Court says the HISTORY of the Act also illuminates the legislative intent (mid pg 795)

The Artists Management Act of 1943 dealt with “a person who engages in the occupation of advising, counseling, or directing artists in the development or advancement of their professional careers and who procures, offers, promises or attempts to procure employment or engagements for an artist.

The Talent Agencies Act made a big change: A talent agency is hereby defined to be a person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring, of-fering, promising, or attempting to procure employment for an artist. (pg 795 mid)

Big change of emphasis!

Church v. Brown, CA Labor Commissioner, 1994, pg 797

The California Courts formulations starts out small. After Wachs it sounds like the TAA only applies to those for whom “the procurement function constitutes a significant part of their business.” (pg 796 bot)(4th)

Waisbren v. Peppercorn Productions, Cal. App. (1995) (pg 797 mid) (4th). The Court goes even further: “personal managers must be licensed under the Act even if they devote just a ‘minimal’ or ‘incidental’ proportion of their overall representation to procuring employment.” (pg 797) Now it’s a total ban:

Under the statute, an unlicensed manager can only “participate in negotiating an employment contract for an artist . . . ‘in conjunction with, and at the request of, a licensed talent agency.” Baker v. BNB Assoc., CA Labor Commissioner, 1997, pg 797 bot

Singing star Anita Baker sues her manager, Sherwin Bush, who is a BNB Associate.Manager Bush argues, “Hey, I’m just a conduit. I don’t solicit.” Court said, “Negotiations that ‘exploit’ employment offers emanating from the outside constitute solicitation within the meaning of the Talent Agencies Act.” (pg 797 bot)

Park v. Deftones, CA App. 1999, pg 798

Park calls himself a “personal manager” but he secures over 80 concert gigs for the Deftones. Labor commissioner finds Park’s entire contract with Deftones “null, void, and unenforceable.” “even incidental is regulated.” Query: Why doesn’t recording contract exception apply? (pg 798 mid ).

Snipes represented by CAA. After he became a big star, he added Dolores Robinson, his manager, who had been recommended by CAA.  799

5 years later he tried to get rid of Dolores by claiming that she was acting as his agent. 

What did Robinson show at the Commission hearing?

“That any such roles were performed by her “at the request of and in conjunction with” the people at CAA.

The basic message, then, is that if a Snipes, unlike a Baker, a Deftones, or an Arsenio Hall, chooses to have both an agent and a manager who each collaborate in their client’s representation, almost certainly the performer can and will have to pay for both. (pg 873 top)

### Title: Marathon Entertainment v. Blasi(Cal 2008)

#### Body 

In December 1998, Marathon made oral k with Blasi for 15% of her earnings.
Blasi has an agent throughout.
Terminates mgt K with Marathon in fall of 2001.
Asserts violation of Act’s licensing requirements as defense to pay.

#### Presenter Notes: 

In December 1998, Marathon and Blasi entered into an oral contract for Marathon to serve as Blasi's personal manager in exchange for a percentage of her entertainment employment income. Blasi, who was represented by a licensed talent agent throughout the term of her personal management contract with Marathon, terminated the management contract in the fall of 2001. 

Thereafter, Blasi successfully invoked Marathon's alleged violation of the Act's licensing requirements as a defense to her obligation to pay Marathon a commission on her 2000-2001 earnings from the television series Strong Medicine, an engagement that Blasi does not contend was procured by Marathon in violation of the Act. After being sued by Marathon for the unpaid Strong Medicine commission, Blasi moved for summary judgment of the complaint, contending that Marathon's unlicensed {Slip Opn. Page 3} solicitations of other, unrelated employment opportunities on her behalf had so tainted with illegality the parties' oral management contract that the entire contract must be invalidated as an illegal contract for unlicensed talent agency services. Blasi produced no evidence in the trial court, however, linking the procurement of her Strong Medicine employment contract with any illegal activity or violation of the Act by Marathon. The trial court, without considering the applicability of the general rule of severability of contracts, granted the motion and entered summary judgment for Blasi.
        In other words, Blasi did not produce evidence that Marathon had violated the statute by seeking employment for Blasi on the series “Strong Medicine,” although there was evidence produced that Marathon had sought employment for Blasi in other instances.  Blasi contended that such seeking employment, even if not related to “Strong Medicine,” “tainted” the overall contractual relationship so that it was not possible to separate the elements of that relationship and thus the entire contractual relationship should be voided.

#### Body 

Conflicts mean contacts.

In the litigation Billy Joel vs. Alan Grubman on pg 801 SETTLED

Ziffren Law Firm bot 801(4th) SETTLED   800

Especially a problem for lawyers who represent studios and talent BOTH.

CAA and Ovitz. So CAA represents all of the talent in Hollywood, while Ovitz is playing a big role in Sony purchasing Columbia Pictures for $3.4 billion and others. Dicey!

Flip side: Conflicts means contacts!

See Ziffren examples on 801(bot)(4th)

Agents must have no conflicts! California amended TAA to bar agents from referring their artists to firms in which the talent agency has a financial interest (or from which the agent receives a referral fee). THIS IS THE REASON AGENTS ARE SO IMPORTANT

Illegal for agents to have tangible conflicts.

The tougher question is posed by cases where the same agent (or manager or lawyer) has two clients who themselves have conflicting interests. 

Here the law basically controls only those entertainment representatives who are lawyers and thus governed by standards of legal ethics.

## Slide 49

### Title: Croce v. Kurnit (USDC NY 1982)

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

Who is Kurnit??  804

These damn lawyers ARE IN EVERY CASE!!!

Croce’s college buddy Tommy West has record company CP&W and introduces Croce and his wife to “the lawyer, Philip Kurnit” and discussed possibility of making records.

Two months later another meeting with Kurnit, who Croce’s knew was a partner in CP&W. 

Kurnit not retained or paid by Croces. Kurnit did not advise them to get their own lawyer. Page 806-807. 

Kurnit isn’t Croce’s lawyer and did not act as their lawyer, but: Kurnit’s introduction as “the lawyer,” his explanation to the Croces of the “legal ramifications” of the contracts which contained a number of legal terms and concepts, his interest as a principal in the transactions, his failure to advise the Croce’s to obtain outside counsel, and the Croce’s lack of representation taken together establish both a fiduciary duty on the part of Kurnit and a breach of that duty. (pg 807 top)(4th)

Court says however that the contract does not shock the conscience or affront decency or other magic words. So it is not going to let Croce’s wife out of the deal. Terms of contract not unconscionable (pg 808 mid) 

Rule 8.4(c) provides that “it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to . . engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.”

## Slide 50

### Title: Model Rule 8.4: Misconduct

#### Body 

It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:
 violate or attempt to violate the Rules . . . 
 commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer;
 engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;
 engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; 
 state or imply an ability to influence improperly a government agency or official  or 
 knowingly assist a judge or judicial officer in conduct that is a violation of applicable rules of judicial conduct or other law.

### Title: “No man can serve two masters . . .”

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

The original conflict of interest rule

BUT THAT WAS BEFORE WE HAD LAWYERS 

Now we have lawyers who naturally want as many clients as possible, 
and so we have some really thorny rules governing conflicts of interest.

Whiskey is for drinking but water is for fighting about. And with all the fighting comes conflicts.

## Slide 52

### Title: Rule 1.7(a)

#### Body 

Except
 A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest. 

#### Presenter Notes: 

Before we do “direct adversity” and “materially limited”, let’s tamper with A itself:

CLICK  There’s our not so favorite introductory clause

Let’s replace it CLICK and pretend that it says: Except with informed consent (which is what it USUALLY does mean) CLICK

And that gives us: 
Except with informed consent: A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest.

So NO CONFLICTS we get informed consent. 

And we know from the overview that there are two flavors of concurrent conflicts.

## Slide 53

### Title: Direct Adversity: Easy!

#### Body 

A . . . concurrent conflict . . . exists if: 
one client will be directly adverse to another client; 

#### Presenter Notes: 

The first DIRECT ADVERSITY is usually easy. 

Lawyers are good at spotting direct adversity.

Directly adverse conflicts constitute only about 10% of disciplinary actions arising out of conflicts of interest.

These are usually litigation-type conflicts. You can’t represent joint defendants in a murder trial where there’s only one shooter. 

You probably shouldn’t represent both the driver and a passenger in an automobile accident if there’s any question about the driver’s negligence. 

The trial lawyers and the litigators have it pretty easy when it comes to conflicts. 
They are used to representing people who are fighting. 

It can trickier when lawyers are helping people form businesses or do estate planning or trying to sort out water rights. THERE you are often dealing with small groups of people who are NOT DIRECTLY ADVERSE . . . YET.

## Slide 54

### Title: Materially Limited: Hard!

#### Body 

A . . . conflict . . . exists if:
(a)(1) . . . direct adversity
(a)(2) there is a RISK that the representation . . . will be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to:

#### Presenter Notes: 

Let’s look at the hard ones, the Materially limited conflicts.

These are the tricky ones, which cause roughly 85-90% of CONFLICT disciplinary actions. 

These deal with the CONCEPT of a RISK. 



## Slide 55

### Title: Informed Consent

Notwithstanding . . . a . . . conflict , 
a lawyer may represent a client if:

#### Presenter Notes: 

So, did 1.7 (a) and found you have a conflict. B helps you decide if it can be cured. 

And now let’s look at each of those FOUR CONDITIONS separately

 

## Slide 56

### Title: 

#### Body 

The lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer can provide competent and diligent representation.

#### Presenter Notes: 

(1)

Can the lawyer manage it, 

Don’t gloss over this. Lawyers have a bad tendency to think they can ALWAYS provide competent and diligent representation.

Also note the use of REASONABLY. So we have a REASONABLE lawyer standard.

Is a REASONABLE lawyer going to believe that you were capable of representing Larry King and all 7 of his ex wives?

## Slide 57

### Title: 

#### Body 

The representation is not prohibited by law.

#### Presenter Notes: 

 (2)

Is it against the law, (some states won’t let you represent both the husband and wife) even in an amicable divorce;

other states won’t let you represent both the buyer and a seller in a real estate transaction. Others say no joint defendants in capital murder cases.

You just have to check.


## Slide 58

### Title: 

#### Body 

The representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by one client against another client represented by the lawyer in the same litigation or other proceeding before a tribunal. 

#### Presenter Notes: 

(3) does it involve representing adverse parties in the same litigation.

Rule 1.0 Terminology

(m) "Tribunal" denotes a court, an arbitrator in a binding arbitration proceeding or a legislative body, administrative agency or other body acting in an adjudicative capacity. A legislative body, administrative agency or other body acts in an adjudicative capacity when a neutral official, after the presentation of evidence or legal argument by a party or parties, will render a binding legal judgment directly affecting a party's interests in a particular matter.

Those three are pretty easy. Then we come to another hard one,

 AND
each affected client gives INFORMED CONSENT, 
confirmed in writing.

#### Presenter Notes: 

“Each affected client gives informed consent confirmed in writing.”

Why “confirmed in writing,” why not just a “signed writing,” as we see in some of the other rules? 

Why not just consent as we see in still others?

## Slide 60

### Title: Informed ConsentConfirmed In Writing

#### Body 

Rule 1.7, Comment 20:  “The requirement of a writing does not supplant the need in most cases for the lawyer to TALK WITH THE CLIENT . . . ”
 “Rather, the writing is required to impress upon the client the seriousness of the decision . . .”

#### Presenter Notes: 

Well, the ABA has something specific in mind. They want you to TALK TO THE CLIENT and EXPLAIN all of the benefits and the risks of consenting to a conflict of interest. 

Then they want you to send a writing—an e-mail, a letter, an engagement agreement– a writing that impresses the importance of the decision on the client. 

“and avoid disputes or ambiguities that might later occur.”

Don’t pass up the chance to spell out the particulars. 

IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE SIGNED BY THE CLIENT

## Slide 61

### Title: Informed Consent

#### Body 

Must include specific descriptions about conflicts and risks of conflicts. 
Blanket general waivers are not INFORMED consent. 
If the risks were foreseeable risks, you have to spell them out.

#### Presenter Notes: 

Blanket general waivers are NOT informed consent. 

You have to identify and describe all of the conflicts and the risks of conflicts that you wisely foresaw when you assessed the representation under 1.7(a).

AND you have to do that for EACH AFFECTED CLIENT.

“You three chums all want to form a partnership. If you start fighting with each other, do I represent the partnership?” 

## Slide 62

### Title: ABKCO Music v. Harrisongs Music(2nd Cir 1983)

#### Body 

Former Beatles manager discloses confidential information about George Harrison’s MSL sales and injects self into settlement negotiations with Bright Tunes.

#### Presenter Notes: 

pg 812 (4th) ABKCO and Klein were agents to principal, George Harrison.

But the management contract ended in 1973. So what is the problem? 

Klein still owes duties to Harrison, even though mgt K has ended.

An agent has a duty “not to use confidential knowledge acquired in his employment in competition with his principal.”

This duty “exists as well after the employment is terminated.”

## Slide 63

### Title: Gershunoff v. Panov (NY 1980)

#### Body 

The Panovs are Russian dancers and Gershunoff is their “impresario manager'”
Gershunoff takes 20% commission. 
During trial, we find out Gershunoff took $25K for a performance for a promotion fee, while the dancers were paid only $10K. 

#### Presenter Notes: 

Gershunoff argues that he's like a producer. The New York Appellate Division
disagrees, finding a clear-cut breach of Gershunoff's fiduciary duties to his
clients. Court awards \$255K to Panovs.

Similar to Garry Shandling/Brad Grey case. 

I ASKED YOU TO READ THE QUESTIONS PRESENTED ON p. 816(4th)

Can you represent both sides in a lawsuit? 

E.g. Kim Basinger’s trial attorney (in contract dispute) also represents her agents, who told her she could get out of the deal? (p. 816)

What if Jim Croce had given written consent for Kurnit to represent?

## Slide 64

### Title: Garry Shandling v. Brad Grey

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

Gary Shandling and Brillstein-Grey, pgs 818-820(4th)

Bernie Brillstein & Brad Grey (currently CEO of Paramount). Anthony Pellicano case.

In 1996, Brillstein sold his shares of the Brillstein-Grey company to Grey, giving Grey full rein over operations; 

the company’s television unit was subsequently rechristened ”Brad Grey Television”.

 In 2002, Grey formed Plan B with Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, with a first-look deal at Warner Bros. 

After Pitt and Aniston separated, Grey and Pitt moved the company to Paramount Pictures, where Grey had become CEO after Sherry Lansing left.

 Gary Shandling was a funny guy in the 1970s. Met up with Brad Grey in 1979, becoming Grey’s second client. 1985, Brillstein-Grey formed. 

Shandling formed a partnership with BGE to sell Garry Shandling Show to Showtime. Shandling was the star, writer, and co-producer. Grey served and was paid as executive producer.

Next show, the Larry Sanders Show on HBO. Again Shandling, the star, writer and producer was getting paid $500K for each of the 16 episodes and owned half of the rights. 

BGE owned the other half, and Grey was paid $50,000 per episode as executive producer. While BGE also charged a 15% commission for negotiating Shandler’s compensation, charged nothing for Grey’s fees.

## Slide 65

### Title: Garry Shandling v. Brad Grey

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

Things end badly.   Pellicano

Shandling eventually sues Grey and his firm for $100 million in damages. 

Essence of Shandling’s claim is that Grey had violated his fiduciary obligation to his client by using Shandling’s personal talent, story ideas, and reputation as the major asset through which to secure partnerships with Columbia Pictures, ABC/Capital Cities, and MCA/Universal. 

Shandling argued that Grey’s primary duty was to enhance Shandling’s return on those assets. 

Shandling now wants half. Scary suit for managers. It raises the question: 

Do managers always owe a fiduciary duty to their clients to pursue just their interests in any such projects. 

If Brad Grey or Ovitz wants to pursue their own interests in such a project must they disavow any representation of the performer and force the latter to hire another manager to get the best deal possible for the client?

What’s one easy solution here? Use an agent to negotiate salaries and payments?

SETTLED - HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND IS USUALLY CONFIDENTIAL.

Note, these problems don’t exist in the music biz (pg 820-21)(4th). See Geffen and Irving Azoff in middle paragraph.

### Title: Music

#### Body 



#### Presenter Notes: 

The music industry (or music business) sells compositions, recordings and performances of music. 

Musicians who compose and perform the music; the companies and professionals who create and sell recorded music (e.g., music publishers, producers, studios, engineers, record labels, retail and online music stores, performance rights organisations); those that present live music performances (booking agents, promoters, music venues, road crew); professionals who assist musicians with their careers (talent managers, business managers, entertainment lawyers); those who broadcast music (satellite and broadcast radio); journalists; educators; musical instrument manufacturers; as well as many others.

### Title: Risk that lawyer’s responsibilities will be materially limited by: 

#### Body 

another client, 
a former client 
or a third person 
or by a personal interest of the lawyer.

#### Presenter Notes: 

The RISK that the lawyer’s responsibilities will be compromised by: 

ANOTHER CLIENT, A FORMER CLIENT, A THIRD PERSON, THE PERSONAL INTEREST OF THE LAWYER

This is the HEART OF THE MATTER: Non-litigation Conflicts. Comments 26-28 of 1.7.

You are dealing with multiple clients who like each other, even LOVE each other. They WANT to use one lawyer. 

It often makes sense for a family to use one estate planning lawyer. I’m sure there are situations where it makes sense for groups of farmers or ranchers to use ONE WATER RIGHTS lawyer ASSUMING THERE IS NO RISK THAT YOUR REPRESENTATION OF ANY ONE OF THEM WILL BE MATERIALLY LIMITED by your representation of any one of them.

Many times it’s helpful just to constantly ask WHO IS THE CLIENT and WHO IS NOT THE CLIENT. 

You best friend and two other neighbors want to hire to set up a closely held corporation and represent them on a regular basis. 

Don’t be what commentators call a LAWYER TO THE SITUATION. Here’s a big mess. I can sort it out because I’m a lawyer and I can do what’s right by everybody. Start small. Asks

WHO IS THE CLIENT? Your best friend? The two neighbors? All of them? The corporation? Even if it means your best friend comes in second behind the two neighbors.

Is there a RISK of a conflict?

That’s 1.7 (a): It asks the question: IS THERE A CONFLICT or a RISK of a CONFLICT, if the answer is YES, we go to 1.7(b)
