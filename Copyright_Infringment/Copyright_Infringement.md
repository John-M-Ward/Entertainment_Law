## Infringement & Fair Use

###### Copying, Substantial Similarity, Parody


### Infringement

Copyright is violated only if the prior work has been *copied.* 

If I write an original song, then you come along, *copy* it, and publish it under your name, that's a copyright violation. 

If I write an original song, and you just happen to INDEPENDENTLY create an identical song, even though you have never heard my song or read my music, I have no recourse against you under the copyright laws. 

Therefore to prove copyright infringement, the copyright holder must prove that the accused infringers HAD ACCESS TO THE ORIGINAL WORK and COPIED it. 

Judge Learned Hand put it this way:

> If by some magic a man who had never known it were to compose anew Keats's *Ode on a Grecian Urn*, he would be an 'author,' and if he copyright it, others might not copy that poem, though they might of course copy Keats's . . .

To prove copyright infringement, the copyright holder must establish:

1. Ownership of a valid copyright.
2. Copying, which may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.  

##### *Bright Tunes Music Corp. v. Harrisongs Music*

Probably the most famous copyright infringement suit of all time. 

First listen to [*He's So Fine,*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU5qP20iJl0&feature=kp), a hit song composed by Ronnie Mack and performed by The Chiffons in the sixties.

Then listen to George Harrison's massive soulful hit [*My Sweet Lord*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kNGnIKUdMI&feature=kp).

Now see if you can tell why the Chiffons sued? Five years of litigation ensued, resulting in a verdict for Mack and against Harrison. The case stands for the unsettling proposition that copyright infringement need not be intentional, and indeed may even be "unconscious" or take place in the "subconscious." Metaphysics meets copyright. When your client wrote her song, did she unintentionally infringe on lullaby her mother sang to her?

As the district court observed:

> Seeking the wellsprings of musical composition why a composer chooses the succession of notes and the harmonies he does whether it be George Harrison or Richard Wagner is a fascinating inquiry. It is apparent from the extensive colloquy between the Court and Harrison covering forty pages in the transcript that neither Harrison nor [Billy Preston] were conscious of the fact that they were utilizing the *He's So Fine* theme. However, they in fact were, for it is perfectly obvious to the listener that in musical terms, the two songs are virtually identical except for one phrase.

> What happened? I conclude that the composer, in seeking musical materials to clothe his thoughts, was working with various possibilities. As he tried this possibility and that, there came to the surface of his mind a particular combination that pleased him as being one he felt would be appealing to a prospective listener; in other words, that this combination of sounds would work. Why? Because his subconscious knew it already had worked in a song his conscious mind did not remember. Having arrived at this pleasing combination of sounds, the recording was made, the lead sheet prepared for copyright and the song became an enormous success. Did Harrison deliberately use the music of He's So Fine? I do not believe he did so deliberately. Nevertheless, it is clear that *My Sweet Lord* is the very same song as *He's So Fine* with different words, and Harrison had access to *He's So Fine*. This is, under the law, infringement of copyright, and is no less so even though subconsciously accomplished

##### *Selle v. Gibb,* (7th Cir. 1984)

Ronald Selle composed “Let It End” in the fall of 1975, secured copyright, and played it a few times with his band in Chicago. Selle sent the tape and sheet music to record companies, with no luck.

Then Selle saw the hit movie *Saturday Night Fever* and heard “How Deep Is Your Love?” by the Bee Gees. Selle brought an action against the Bee Gees alleging copyright infringement and claiming that the Bee Gees must have copied Selle's "Let It End" in composing "How Deep Is Your Love".

Plaintiff Selle called only one expert: Dr. Arrond Parsons, a professor of classical music. Parsons had never done song comparisons. 

The jury decided in favor of plaintiff Selle, but the judge granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Why? No access! The district court said that **proof of copying is essential.** If no direct evidence of access, then inference of access may be established by striking similarity. But circumstantial evidence of access may be rebutted by evidence that the work was created independently, or that both copies are based on a common source in the  public domain.

> Two works may be identical in every detail, but, if the alleged infringer created the accused work independently or both works were copied from a common source in the public domain, then there is no infringement. Therefore, if the plaintiff admits to having kept his or her creation under lock and key, it would seem logically impossible to infer access through striking similarity. Thus, although it has frequently been written that striking similarity alone can establish access, the decided cases suggest that this circumstance would be most unusual. The plaintiff must always present sufficient evidence to support a reasonable possibility of access because the jury cannot draw an inference of access based upon speculation and conjecture alone.

*   [*Selle v. Gibb,*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=741f2d896&appflag=67.12) 741 F.2d 896 (7th Cir. 1984). [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selle_v._Gibb).  

#### Substantial Similarity: Books, Plays, Movies

*Nichols v Universal* (2d Cir. 1930). Judge Learned Hand compared a play, *Abie's Irish Rose*, with a movie *The Cohens and the Kellys* in a copyright suit.

Copyright in literary works “cannot be limited literally to the text, else a plagiarist would escape by immaterial variations.” Instead, Judge Hand formulated "the abstractions test":

> Upon any work, and especially upon a play, a great number of patterns of increasing generality will fit equally well, as more and more of the incident is left out. The last may perhaps be no more than the most general statement of what the play is about, and at times might consist only of its title; but there is a point in this series of abstractions where they are no longer protected, since otherwise the playwright could prevent the use of his 'ideas,' to which, apart from their expression, his property is never extended . . . .  Nobody has ever been able to fix that boundary, and nobody ever can. In some cases the question has been treated as though it were analogous to lifting a portion out of the copyrighted work; but the analogy is not a good one, because though the skeleton is a part of the body, it pervades and supports the whole. In such cases we are rather concerned with the line between expression and what is expressed.”

### Fair Use ###

* [Fair Use](http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html) (very short "official" explanation of fair use).

> Fair use is a DEFENSE to copyright infringement. It allows the taking of some part of a copyrighted work without the need to secure the author's permission. Examples of fair use include: news reporting, criticism, comment, teaching . . . parody, scholarship, or research.

> *Pocket Lawyer For Filmmakers,* 2nd Edition, page 245.

#### Copyright Statute

###### § 107 -Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use

> Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include: 

1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
2. the nature of the copyrighted work;
3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.

#### Who decides whether use of a copyrighted work was fair?

The court does. AFTER the fact. Meaning that the accused infringer has already been hauled into court by the copyright holder. Attorneys fees (kaching!) This why copyright CLEARANCES and LICENSING are essential BEFORE the movie is made. Clearances are designed to keep the artist from being sued in the first place.

###### Harper & Row v. The Nation (Sct. 1985)

The Watergate Scandall forced Richard Nixon to resign as President of the United States in 1974. Vice President Gerald Ford became president, and thirty days later granted Nixon a full pardon for any crimes he may have committed while in office. 

The decision caused an outrcy in the press and public indignation from citizens (particularly Democracts) who wanted Nixon tried, convicted, and possibly sent to prison. 

Five years later, Ford published *A Time to Heal: The Autobiography of Gerald R. Ford.* and was marketed in part as Ford's chance to explain his decision to pardon Nixon. 

In March 1979, weeks before Ford's publisher *Harper & Row* planned to publish *A Time To Heal,* an undisclosed source provided The Nation Magazine with Ford's unpublished manuscript. 

Working directly from the bootleg copy of the pages, an editor of The Nation produced a short piece entitled “The Ford Memoirs-Behind the Nixon Pardon.” 

The Nation piece was timed to "scoop" an article scheduled shortly to appear in Time Magazine. Time had agreed to purchase the exclusive right to print prepublication excerpts from the copyright holders, Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. ("Harper"). When Time found out about The Nation article, Time canceled its agreement. 

Harper sued The Nation for copyright infringement and won. 

On appeal, the Second Circuit reversed the lower court's finding of infringement, holding that The Nation's act was sanctioned as a “fair use” of the copyrighted material. 

The Supreme Court reversed. Writing for the majority Justice Sandra Day O'Connor acknowledged that the Second Circuit was correct to note that Ford's book was "news" and mostly "facts," the kind of material that militates in favor of a fair use finding. But O'Connor placed greater emphasis on the author's publishing rights under &#167;106:

> The right of first publication implicates a threshold decision by the author whether and in what form to release his work. First publication is inherently different from other §106 rights in that only one person can be the first publisher; as the contract with Time illustrates, the commercial value of the right lies primarily in exclusivity. Because the potential damage to the author from judicially enforced “sharing” of the first publication right with unauthorized users of his manuscript is substantial, the balance of equities in evaluating such a claim of fair use inevitably shifts.

The Court applied the four prongs of the &#167;107 fair use as follows:

1. The purpose and character of the use:

The Court agreed with the Second Circuit that The Nation's purpose in publishing the excerpts was ostensibly "news reporting," and that §107 lists news reporting as one of the exemplary activities tending toward a finding of fair use. But the court insisted that the issue was not what constitutes "news," but whether a claim of newsreporting is a valid fair use defense to an infringement of *copyrightable expression*.”

As for the *character* of The Nation's use, the trial court found that The Nation knowingly exploited a purloined manuscript. The Supreme Court said that: "Fair use presupposes ‘good faith’ and ‘fair dealing,’” which was decidedly lacking in The Nation's conduct.

2. The nature of the copyrighted work:

The Court characterized "A Time to Heal" as an unpublished historical narrative or autobiography. The law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy, but the Court again stressed: "The fact that a work is unpublished is a critical element of its 'nature.'"

> The right of first publication encompasses not only the choice whether to publish at all, but also the choices of when, where, and in what form first to publish a work.

3. Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used. 

As the Court put it: 

> In absolute terms, the words actually quoted were an insubstantial portion of “A Time to Heal.” The District Court, however, found that “[T]he Nation took what was essentially the heart of the book.”

4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

The Court found that "this last factor is undoubtedly the single most important element of fair use." And The Nation's advanced publication of excerpts destroyed the market for first serial rights, because when Time Magazine learned of The Nation's publication it canceled the deal, and with good reason.
