## Infringement & Fair Use

###### Copying, Substantial Similarity, Parody

### Infringement

Copyright is violated only if the prior work has been *copied.* 

If I write an original song, then you come along, *copy* it, and publish it under your name, that's a copyright violation. 

If I write an original song, and you just happen to INDEPENDENTLY create an identical song, even though you have never heard my song or read my music, I have no recourse against you under the copyright laws. 

Therefore to prove copyright infringement, the copyright holder must prove that the accused infringers HAD ACCESS TO THE ORIGINAL WORK and COPIED it. 

Judge Learned Hand put it this way:

> If by some magic a man who had never known it were to compose anew Keats's *Ode on a Grecian Urn*, he would be an 'author,' and if he copyright it, others might not copy that poem, though they might of course copy Keats's . . .

To prove copyright infringement, the copyright holder must establish:

1. Ownership of a valid copyright.
2. Copying, which may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.  

### Bright Tunes Music Corp. v. Harrisongs Music, Ltd.

###### US Southern District New York (1976)

* [Case on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Sweet_Lord#Copyright_infringement_suit).

One of the most famous copyright infringement suit of all time. 

First listen to ["He's So Fine,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU5qP20iJl0&feature=kp), a hit song composed by Ronnie Mack and performed by The Chiffons in the sixties.

Then listen to George Harrison's massive soulful hit ["My Sweet Lord"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kNGnIKUdMI&feature=kp).

Now see if you can tell why the Chiffons sued? Five years of litigation ensued, resulting in a verdict for Mack and against Harrison. The case stands for the unsettling proposition that copyright infringement need not be intentional, and indeed may even be "unconscious" or take place in the "subconscious." Metaphysics meets copyright. When your client wrote her song, did she unintentionally infringe on lullaby her mother sang to her?

OWEN, District Judge.

This is an action in which it is claimed that a successful song, "My
Sweet Lord," listing George Harrison as the composer, is plagiarized from
an earlier successful song, "He's So Fine," composed by Ronald Mack,
recorded by a singing group called the "Chiffons," the copyright of
which is owned by plaintiff, Bright Tunes Music Corp.

'He's So Fine,' recorded in 1962, is a catchy tune consisting essentially
of four repetitions of a very short basic musical phrase, "sol-mi-re,"
(hereinafter motif A), altered as necessary to fit the
words, followed by four repetitions of another short basic musical
phrase, "sol-la-do-la-do," (hereinafter motif B). While
neither motif is novel, the four repetitions of A, followed by four
repetitions of B, is a highly unique pattern. In addition,
in the second use of the motif B series, there is a grace note inserted
making the phrase go "sol-la-do-la-*re*-do."

"My Sweet Lord," recorded first in 1970, also uses the same motif A
(modified to suit the words) four times, followed by motif B, repeated
three times, not four. In place of "He's So Fine's" fourth repetition of
motif B, "My Sweet Lord" has a transitional passage of musical
attractiveness of the same approximate length, with the identical grace
note in the identical second repetition. The harmonies of
both songs are identical.

>Fn. 6. Expert witnesses for the defendants asserted crucial differences in the two songs. These claimed differences essentially stem, however, from the fact that different words and number of syllables were involved. This necessitated modest alterations in the repetitions or the places of beginning of a phrase, which, however, has nothing to do whatsoever with the essential musical kernel that is involved.

George Harrison, a former member of The Beatles, was aware of
"He's So Fine." In the United States, it was No. 1 on the billboard charts
for five weeks; in England, Harrison's home country, it was No. 12 on
the charts on June 1, 1963, a date upon which one of the Beatle songs
was, in fact, in first position. For seven weeks in 1963, "He's So Fine"
was one of the top hits in England.

According to Harrison, the circumstances of the composition of My "Sweet
Lord" were as follows. Harrison and his group, which include an American
black gospel singer named Billy Preston, were in
Copenhagen, Denmark, on a singing engagement. There was a press
conference involving the group going on backstage. Harrison slipped away
from the press conference and went to a room upstairs and began
"vamping" some guitar chords, fitting on to the chords he was playing
the words, "Hallelujah" and "Hare Krishna" in various ways.
During the course of this vamping, he was alternating between what
musicians call a Minor II chord and a Major V chord.

At some point &hellip; he went down to meet with others
of the group, asking them to listen, which they did, and everyone began
to join in, taking first "Hallelujah" and then "Hare Krishna" and
putting them into four part harmony. Harrison obviously started using
the "Hallelujah," etc., as repeated sounds, and from there developed the
lyrics, to wit, "My Sweet Lord," "Dear, Dear Lord," etc. In any event,
from this very free-flowing exchange of ideas, with Harrison playing his
two chords and everybody singing "Hallelujah" and "Hare Krishna," there
began to emerge the My Sweet Lord text idea, which Harrison sought to
develop a little bit further during the following week as he was playing
it on his guitar. Thus developed motif A and its words interspersed with
"Hallelujah" and "Hare Krishna."

>Fn. 8. These words ended up being a "responsive" interjection between the eventually copyrighted words of "My Sweet Lord." In "He's So Fine", the Chiffons used the sound "dulang" in the same places to fill in and give rhythmic impetus to what would otherwise be somewhat dead spots in the music.

Approximately one week after the idea first began to germinate, the
entire group flew back to London because they had earlier booked time to
go to a recording studio with Billy Preston to make an album. In the
studio, Preston was the principal musician. Harrison did not play in the
session. He had given Preston his basic motif A with the idea that it be
turned into a song, and was back and forth from the studio to the
engineer's recording booth, supervising the recording "takes." Under
circumstances that Harrison was utterly unable to recall, while
everybody was working toward a finished song, in the recording studio,
somehow or other the essential three notes of motif A reached polished
form.

> "Q. [By the Court]: . . . you feel that those three notes . . . the
> motif A in the record, those three notes developed somewhere in that
> recording session?

> "Mr. Harrison: I'd say those three there were finalized as beginning
> there."

> \* \* \* \* \* \*

> "Q. [By the Court]: Is it possible that Billy Preston hit on those
> [notes comprising motif A]?

> "Mr. Harrison: Yes, but it's possible also that I hit on that, too, as
> far back as the dressing room, just scat singing."

Similarly, it appears that motif B emerged in some fashion at the
recording session as did motif A. This is also true of the unique grace
note in the second repetition of motif B.

\* \* \*

The Billy Preston recording, listing George Harrison as the composer,
was thereafter issued by Apple Records. The music was then reduced to
paper by someone who prepared a "lead sheet" containing the melody, the
words and the harmony for the United States copyright
application.

Seeking the wellsprings of musical composition---why a composer chooses
the succession of notes and the harmonies he does---whether it be George
Harrison or Richard Wagner---is a fascinating inquiry. It is apparent from
the extensive colloquy between the Court and Harrison covering forty
pages in the transcript that neither Harrison nor Preston were conscious
of the fact that they were utilizing the He's So Fine
theme. However, they in fact were, for it is perfectly
obvious to the listener that in musical terms, the two songs are
virtually identical except for one phrase &hellip; [The judge then noted that "even Harrison's own expert witness acknowledged that although the two motifs were in the public domain, their use here was so unusual as to make them unique.]

What happened? I conclude that the composer, in seeking
musical materials to clothe his thoughts, was working with various
possibilities. As he tried this possibility and that, there came to the
surface of his mind a particular combination that pleased him as being
one he felt would be appealing to a prospective listener; in other
words, that this combination of sounds would work. Why? Because his
subconscious knew it already had worked in a song his conscious mind did
not remember. Having arrived at this pleasing combination of sounds, the
recording was made, the lead sheet prepared for copyright and the song
became an enormous success. Did Harrison deliberately use the music of
"He's So Fine?" I do not believe he did so deliberately. Nevertheless, it
is clear that "My Sweet Lord" is the very same song as "He's So
Fine" with different words, and Harrison had access to
"He's So Fine." This is, under the law, infringement of copyright, and is
no less so even though subconsciously accomplished. [*Sheldon v.

Given the foregoing, I find for the plaintiff on the issue of
plagiarism, and set the action down for trial on November 8, 1976 on the
issue of damages and other relief as to which the plaintiff may be
entitled. The foregoing constitutes the Court's findings of fact and

### Selle v. Gibb

###### US Court of Appeals (7th Cir. 1984) 

* [case on Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15134673856711698951)
* [case on Westlaw] (http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=741f2d896&appflag=67.12) 
* [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selle_v._Gibb).  

CUDAHY, Circuit Judge.

The plaintiff, Ronald H. Selle, brought a suit against three brothers,
Maurice, Robin and Barry Gibb, known collectively as the popular singing
group, the Bee Gees, alleging that the Bee Gees, in their hit tune, "How
Deep Is Your Love," had infringed the copyright of his song, "Let It
End." The jury returned a verdict in plaintiff Selle's favor on the issue of
liability in a bifurcated trial. The district court, Judge George N.
Leighton, granted the defendants' motion for judgment notwithstanding
the verdict and, in the alternative, for a new trial. [*Selle v. Gibb,* (N.D.Ill.
1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11567908603789103293).
We affirm the grant of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the
verdict.

## I

Selle composed his song, "Let It End," in one day in the fall of 1975
and obtained a copyright for it on November 17, 1975. He played his song
with his small band two or three times in the Chicago area and sent a
tape and lead sheet of the music to eleven music recording and
publishing companies. Eight of the companies returned the materials to
Selle; three did not respond. This was the extent of the public
dissemination of Selle's song. [More facts at *Selle v. Gibb* (N.D.Ill.1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11567908603789103293).

Selle first became aware of
the Bee Gees' song, "How Deep Is Your Love," in May 1978 and thought
that he recognized the music as his own, although the lyrics were
different. He also saw the movie, "Saturday Night Fever," the sound
track of which features the song "How Deep Is Your Love," and again
recognized the music. He subsequently sued the three Gibb brothers;
Paramount Pictures Corporation, which made and distributed the movie;
and Phonodisc, Inc., now known as Polygram Distribution, Inc., which
made and distributed the cassette tape of "How Deep Is Your Love."

The Bee Gees are internationally known performers and creators of
popular music. They have composed more than 160 songs;  their
sheet music, records and tapes have been distributed worldwide, some of
the albums selling more than 30 million copies. The Bee Gees, however,
do not themselves read or write music. In composing a song, their
practice was to tape a tune, which members of their staff would later
transcribe and reduce to a form suitable for copyrighting, sale and
performance by both the Bee Gees and others.

In addition to their own testimony at trial, the Bee Gees presented
testimony by their manager, Dick Ashby, and two musicians, Albhy Galuten
and Blue Weaver, who were on the Bee Gees' staff at the time "How Deep
Is Your Love" was composed. These witnesses described in detail how, in
January 1977, the Bee Gees and several members of their staff went to a
recording studio in the Chateau d'Herouville about 25 miles northwest of
Paris. There the group composed at least six new songs and mixed a live
album. Barry Gibb's testimony included a detailed explanation of a work
tape which was introduced into evidence and played in court. This tape
preserves the actual process of creation during which the brothers, and
particularly Barry, created the tune of the accused song while Weaver, a
keyboard player, played the tune which was hummed or sung by the
brothers. Although the tape does not seem to preserve the very beginning
of the process of creation, it does depict the process by which ideas,
notes, lyrics and bits of the tune were gradually put together.

Following completion of this work tape, a demo tape was made. The work
tape, demo tape and a vocal-piano version taken from the demo tape are
all in the key of E flat. Lead sheet music, dated March 6, 1977, is in
the key of E. On March 7, 1977, a lead sheet of "How Deep Is Your Love"
was filed for issuance of a United States copyright, and in November
1977, a piano-vocal arrangement was filed in the Copyright Office.

The only expert witness to testify at trial was Arrand Parsons, a
professor of music at Northwestern University who has had extensive
professional experience primarily in classical music. He has been a
program annotator for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the New Orleans
Symphony Orchestra and has authored works about musical theory. Prior to
this case, however, he had never made a comparative analysis of two
popular songs. Dr. Parsons testified on the basis of several charts
comparing the musical notes of each song and a comparative recording
prepared under his direction.

According to Dr. Parsons' testimony, the first eight bars of each song
(Theme A) have twenty-four of thirty-four notes in plaintiff's
composition and twenty-four of forty notes in defendants' composition
which are identical in pitch and symmetrical position. Of thirty-five
rhythmic impulses in plaintiff's composition and forty in defendants',
thirty are identical. In the last four bars of both songs (Theme B),
fourteen notes in each are identical in pitch, and eleven of the
fourteen rhythmic impulses are identical. Both Theme A and Theme B
appear in the same position in each song but with different intervening
material.

Dr. Parsons testified that, in his opinion, "the two songs had such
striking similarities that they could not have been written independent
of one another." He also testified that he did not know of two
songs by different composers "that contain as many striking
similarities" as do the two songs at issue here. However, on several
occasions, he declined to say that the similarities could only have
resulted from copying.

Following presentation of the case, the jury returned a verdict for the
plaintiff on the issue of liability, the only question presented to the
jury. Judge Leighton, however, granted the defendants' motion for
judgment notwithstanding the verdict and, in the alternative, for a new
trial. He relied primarily on the plaintiff's inability to demonstrate
that the defendants had access to the plaintiff's song, without which a
claim of copyright infringement could not prevail regardless how similar
 the two compositions are. Further, the plaintiff failed to
contradict or refute the testimony of the defendants and their witnesses
describing the independent creation process of "How Deep Is Your Love."
Finally, Judge Leighton concluded that "the inferences on which
plaintiff relies is not a logical, permissible deduction from proof of
'striking similarity' or substantial similarity; it is 'at war with
the undisputed facts,' and it is inconsistent with the proof of
nonaccess to plaintiff's song by the Bee Gees at the time in question."
[567 F.Supp. at
1183](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11567908603789103293).

## II

Both we and the district court must be reluctant to remove an issue from
the purview of the jury on either a directed verdict or a judgment
notwithstanding the verdict. Nonetheless, we have a duty to determine
whether there is sufficient evidence to support the position of the
nonmoving party, in this case, the plaintiff. The standards applicable
to a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and to a directed
verdict are, of course, the same. All the evidence, taken as a whole,
must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. This
evidence must provide a sufficient basis from which the jury could have
reasonably reached a verdict without speculation or drawing unreasonable
inferences which conflict with the undisputed facts (citations omitted). 

## III

Selle's primary contention on this appeal is that the district court
misunderstood the theory of proof of copyright infringement on which he
based his claim. Under this theory, copyright infringement can be
demonstrated when, even in the absence of any direct evidence of access,
the two pieces in question are so strikingly similar that access can be
inferred from such similarity alone. Selle argues that the testimony of
his expert witness, Dr. Parsons, was sufficient evidence of such
striking similarity that it was permissible for the jury, even in the
absence of any other evidence concerning access, to infer that the Bee
Gees had access to plaintiff's song and indeed copied it.

In establishing a claim of copyright infringement of a musical
composition, the plaintiff must prove:

1. ownership of the copyright in the complaining work; 
2. originality of the work; 
3. copying of the work by the defendant, and 
4. a substantial degree of similarity between the two works. 

The only element which is at issue
in this appeal is proof of copying; the first two elements are
essentially conceded, while the fourth (substantial similarity) is, at
least in these circumstances, closely related to the third element under
plaintiff's theory of the case.

Proof of copying is crucial to any claim of copyright infringement
because no matter how similar the two works may be (even to the point of
identity), if the defendant did not copy the accused work, there is no
infringement.&hellip;  However,
because direct evidence of copying is rarely available, the plaintiff
can rely upon circumstantial evidence to prove this essential element,
and the most important component of this sort of circumstantial evidence
is proof of access.&hellip; The plaintiff may be
able to introduce direct evidence of access when, for example, the work
was sent directly to the defendant (whether a musician or a publishing
company) or a close associate of the defendant. On the other hand, the
plaintiff may be able to establish a reasonable possibility of access
when, for example, the complaining work has been widely disseminated to
the public.&hellip; 

If, however, the plaintiff does not have direct evidence of access, then
an inference of access may still be established circumstantially by
proof of similarity which is so striking that the possibilities of
independent creation, coincidence and prior common source are, as a
practical matter, precluded. If the plaintiff presents evidence of
striking similarity sufficient to raise an inference of access, then
copying is presumably proved simultaneously, although the fourth element
(substantial similarity) still requires proof that the defendant copied
a substantial amount of the complaining work. The theory which Selle
attempts to apply to this case is based on proof of copying by
circumstantial proof of access established by striking similarity
between the two works.

One difficulty with plaintiff's theory is that no matter how great the
similarity between the two works, it is not their similarity *per se*
which establishes access; rather, their similarity tends to prove access
in light of the nature of the works, the particular musical genre
involved and other circumstantial evidence of access. In other words,
striking similarity is just one piece of circumstantial evidence tending
to show access and must not be considered in isolation; it must be
considered together with other types of circumstantial evidence relating
to access.

As a threshold matter, therefore, it would appear that there must be at
least some other evidence which would establish a reasonable possibility
that the complaining work was *available* to the alleged infringer. As
noted, two works may be identical in every detail, but, if the alleged
infringer created the accused work independently or both works were
copied from a common source in the public domain, then there is no
infringement. Therefore, if the plaintiff admits to having kept his or
her creation under lock and key, it would seem logically impossible to
infer access through striking similarity. Thus, although it has
frequently been written that striking similarity *alone* can establish
access, the decided cases suggest that this circumstance would be most
unusual. The plaintiff must always present sufficient evidence to
support a reasonable possibility of access because the jury cannot draw
an inference of access based upon speculation and conjecture alone.&hellip; 

The greatest difficulty perhaps arises when the plaintiff cannot
demonstrate any direct link between the complaining work and the
defendant but the work has been so widely disseminated that it is not
unreasonable to infer that the defendant might have had access to it.&hellip; 

In granting the defendants' motion for judgment notwithstanding the
verdict, Judge Leighton relied primarily on the plaintiff's failure to
adduce any evidence of access and stated that an inference of access may
not be based on mere conjecture, speculation or a bare possibility of
access. [567 F.Supp. at 1181](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11567908603789103293).

Thus, in [*Testa v. Janssen,* 492 F.Supp. 198, 202-03 (W.D.Pa.
1980),](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11105954636820891332)
the court stated that "[t]o support a finding of access, plaintiffs'
evidence must extend beyond mere speculation or conjecture. And, while
circumstantial evidence is sufficient to establish access, a defendant's
opportunity to view the copyrighted work must exist by a reasonable
possibility — not a bare possibility" (citations omitted). 

Judge Leighton thus based his decision on what he characterized as the
plaintiff's inability to raise more than speculation that the Bee Gees
had access to his song. The extensive testimony of the defendants and
their witnesses describing the creation process went essentially
uncontradicted, and there was no attempt even to impeach their
credibility. Judge Leighton further relied on the principle that the
testimony of credible witnesses concerning a matter within their
knowledge cannot be rejected without some impeachment, contradiction or
inconsistency with other evidence on the particular point at issue.&hellip; 

Judge Leighton's conclusions that there was no more than a bare
possibility that the defendants could have had access to Selle's song
and that this was an insufficient basis from which the jury could have
reasonably inferred the existence of access seem correct. The plaintiff
has failed to meet even the minimum threshold of proof of the
possibility of access and, as Judge Leighton has stated, an inference of
access would thus seem to be "at war with the undisputed facts." [567
F.Supp. at 1183](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11567908603789103293).

## IV

The grant of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict might,
if we were so minded, be affirmed on the basis of the preceding analysis
of the plaintiff's inability to establish a reasonable inference of
access. This decision is also supported by a more traditional analysis
of proof of access based only on the proof of "striking similarity"
between the two compositions. The plaintiff relies almost exclusively on
the testimony of his expert witness, Dr. Parsons, that the two pieces
were, in fact, "strikingly similar." Yet formulating a
meaningful definition of "striking similarity" is no simple task, and
the term is often used in a conclusory or circular fashion.

Sherman defines "striking similarity" as a term of art signifying "that
degree of similarity as will permit an inference of copying even in the
absence of proof of access...." Sherman, *Musical Copyright
Infringement,* at 84 n. 15. Nimmer states that, absent proof of access,
"the similarities must be so striking as to preclude the possibility
that the defendant independently arrived at the same result." Nimmer,
*Copyright,* at 13-14.

"Striking similarity" is not merely a function of the number of
identical notes that appear in both compositions.&hellip; An important factor in analyzing the degree of similarity of two compositions is the uniqueness of the sections which are asserted to be similar.

If the complaining work contains an unexpected departure from the normal
metric structure or if the complaining work includes what appears to be
an error and the accused work repeats the unexpected element or the
error, then it is more likely that there is some connection between the
pieces.&hellip; If the similar sections are particularly intricate, then again it would
seem more likely that the compositions are related. Finally, some
dissimilarities may be particularly suspicious. *See, e.g.,* [*Meier Co.
v. Albany Novelty Manufacturing Co.,* 236 F.2d 144, 146 (2d
Cir.1956)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16559343953483366400)
(inversion and substitution of certain words in a catalogue in a "crude
effort to give the appearance of dissimilarity" are themselves evidence
of copying); [*Blume v. Spear,* 30 F. 629, 631
(S.D.N.Y.1887)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=6177442844615693296)
(variations in infringing song were placed so as to indicate deliberate
copying); Sherman, *Musical Copyright Infringement,* at 84-88. While
some of these concepts are borrowed from literary copyright analysis,
they would seem equally applicable to an analysis of music.

The judicially formulated definition of "striking similarity" states
that "plaintiffs must demonstrate that 'such similarities are of a kind
that can only be explained by copying, rather than by coincidence,
independent creation, or prior common source.'" [*Testa* (W.D.Pa.1980)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11105954636820891332).

> To prove that certain similarities are "striking," plaintiff must show
> that they are the sort of similarities that cannot satisfactorily be
> accounted for by a theory of coincidence, independent creation, prior
> common source, or any theory other than that of copying. Striking
> similarity is an extremely technical issue — one with which,
> understandably, experts are best equipped to deal.

Sherman, *Musical Copyright Infringement,* at 96.

Finally, the similarities should appear in a sufficiently unique or
complex context as to make it unlikely that both pieces were copied from
a prior common source.&hellip; 

As noted, the plaintiff relies almost entirely on the testimony of his
expert witness, Dr. Arrand Parsons. The defendants did not introduce any
expert testimony, apparently because they did not think Parsons'
testimony needed to be refuted. Defendants are perhaps to some degree
correct in asserting that Parsons, although eminently qualified in the
field of classical music theory, was not equally qualified to analyze
popular music tunes.  More significantly, however, although
Parsons used the magic formula, "striking similarity," he only ruled out
the possibility of independent creation; he did not state that the
similarities could only be the result of copying. In order for proof of
"striking similarity" to establish a reasonable inference of access,
especially in a case such as this one in which the direct proof of
access is so minimal, the plaintiff must show that the similarity is of
a type which will preclude any explanation other than that of copying.

In addition, to bolster the expert's conclusion that independent
creation was not possible, there should be some testimony or other
evidence of the relative complexity or uniqueness of the two
compositions. Dr. Parsons' testimony did not refer to this aspect of the
compositions and, in a field such as that of popular music in which all
songs are relatively short and tend to build on or repeat a basic theme,
such testimony would seem to be particularly necessary. We agree with
the Sixth Circuit which explained that "we do not think the affidavit of
[the expert witness], stating in conclusory terms that 'it is extremely
unlikely that one set [of architectural plans] could have been prepared
without access to the other set,' can fill the gap which is created by
the absence of any direct evidence of access." [*Scholz Homes, Inc. v.
Maddox,* 379 F.2d 84, 86 (6th
Cir.1967)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13045021094752392802).

To illustrate this deficiency more concretely, we refer to a cassette
tape &hellip; and the accompanying chart.&hellip; These exhibits were prepared by the defendants but introduced into evidence by the plaintiff. The tape has recorded on it
segments of both themes from both the Selle and the Gibb songs
interspersed with segments of other compositions as diverse as
"Footsteps," "From Me To You" (a Lennon-McCartney piece), Beethoven's
5th Symphony, "Funny Talk," "Play Down," and "I'd Like To Leave If I
May" (the last two being earlier compositions by Barry
Gibb). There are at least superficial similarities among
these segments, when played on the same musical instrument, and the
plaintiff failed to elicit any testimony from his expert witness about
this exhibit which compared the Selle and the Gibb songs to other pieces
of contemporary, popular music. These circumstances indicate that the
plaintiff failed to sustain his burden of proof on the issue of
"striking similarity" in its legal sense — that is, similarity which
reasonably precludes the possibility of any explanation other than that
of copying.

The plaintiff's expert witness does not seem to have addressed any
issues relating to the possibility of prior common source in both widely
disseminated popular songs and the defendants' own compositions. At oral
argument, plaintiff's attorney stated that the burden of proving common
source should be on the defendant; however, the burden of proving
"striking similarity," which, by definition, includes taking steps to
minimize the possibility of common source, is on the plaintiff. In
essence, the plaintiff failed to prove to the requisite degree that the
similarities identified by the expert witness — although perhaps
"striking" in a non-legal sense — were of a type which would eliminate
any explanation of coincidence, independent creation or common source,
including, in this case, the possibility of common source in earlier
compositions created by the Bee Gees themselves or by others. In sum,
the evidence of striking similarity is not sufficiently compelling to
make the case when the proof of access must otherwise depend largely
upon speculation and conjecture.

Therefore, because the plaintiff failed both to establish a basis from
which the jury could reasonably infer that the Bee Gees had access to
his song and to meet his burden of proving "striking similarity" between
the two compositions, the grant by the district court of the defendants'
motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is  affirmed.

> At oral argument, plaintiff's attorney analyzed the degree
of similarity required to establish an inference of access as being in
an inverse ratio to the quantum of direct evidence adduced to establish
access. While we have found no authoritative support for this analysis,
it seems appropriate. In this case, it would therefore appear that,
because the plaintiff has introduced virtually no direct evidence of
access, the degree of similarity required to establish copying in this
case is considerable.

#### NOTES *Selle v. Gibb,* (7th Cir. 1984)

Ronald Selle composed “Let It End” in the fall of 1975, secured copyright, and played it a few times with his band in Chicago. Selle sent the tape and sheet music to record companies, with no luck.

Then Selle saw the hit movie *Saturday Night Fever* and heard “How Deep Is Your Love?” by the Bee Gees. Selle brought an action against the Bee Gees alleging copyright infringement and claiming that the Bee Gees must have copied Selle's "Let It End" in composing "How Deep Is Your Love".

Plaintiff Selle called only one expert: Dr. Arrond Parsons, a professor of classical music. Parsons had never done song comparisons. 

The jury decided in favor of plaintiff Selle, but the judge granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Why? No access! The district court said that **proof of copying is essential.** If no direct evidence of access, then inference of access may be established by striking similarity. But circumstantial evidence of access may be rebutted by evidence that the work was created independently, or that both copies are based on a common source in the  public domain.

> Two works may be identical in every detail, but, if the alleged infringer created the accused work independently or both works were copied from a common source in the public domain, then there is no infringement. Therefore, if the plaintiff admits to having kept his or her creation under lock and key, it would seem logically impossible to infer access through striking similarity. Thus, although it has frequently been written that striking similarity alone can establish access, the decided cases suggest that this circumstance would be most unusual. The plaintiff must always present sufficient evidence to support a reasonable possibility of access because the jury cannot draw an inference of access based upon speculation and conjecture alone.


#### Substantial Similarity: Books, Plays, Movies

*Nichols v Universal* (2d Cir. 1930). Judge Learned Hand compared a play, *Abie's Irish Rose*, with a movie *The Cohens and the Kellys* in a copyright suit.

Copyright in literary works “cannot be limited literally to the text, else a plagiarist would escape by immaterial variations.” Instead, Judge Hand formulated "the abstractions test":

> Upon any work, and especially upon a play, a great number of patterns of increasing generality will fit equally well, as more and more of the incident is left out. The last may perhaps be no more than the most general statement of what the play is about, and at times might consist only of its title; but there is a point in this series of abstractions where they are no longer protected, since otherwise the playwright could prevent the use of his 'ideas,' to which, apart from their expression, his property is never extended . . . .  Nobody has ever been able to fix that boundary, and nobody ever can. In some cases the question has been treated as though it were analogous to lifting a portion out of the copyrighted work; but the analogy is not a good one, because though the skeleton is a part of the body, it pervades and supports the whole. In such cases we are rather concerned with the line between expression and what is expressed.”

### Fair Use ###

* [Fair Use](http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html) (very short "official" explanation of fair use).

> Fair use is a DEFENSE to copyright infringement. It allows the taking of some part of a copyrighted work without the need to secure the author's permission. Examples of fair use include: news reporting, criticism, comment, teaching . . . parody, scholarship, or research.

> *Pocket Lawyer For Filmmakers,* 2nd Edition, page 245.

#### Copyright Statute

###### § 107 -Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use

> Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include: 

1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
2. the nature of the copyrighted work;
3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.

#### Who decides whether use of a copyrighted work was fair?

The court does. AFTER the fact. Meaning that the accused infringer has already been hauled into court by the copyright holder. Attorneys fees (kaching!) This why copyright CLEARANCES and LICENSING are essential BEFORE the movie is made. Clearances are designed to keep the artist from being sued in the first place.

#### Harper & Row v. The Nation (Sct. 1985)

The Watergate Scandall forced Richard Nixon to resign as President of the United States in 1974. Vice President Gerald Ford became president, and thirty days later granted Nixon a full pardon for any crimes he may have committed while in office. 

The decision caused an outrcy in the press and public indignation from citizens (particularly Democracts) who wanted Nixon tried, convicted, and possibly sent to prison. 

Five years later, Ford published *A Time to Heal: The Autobiography of Gerald R. Ford.* and was marketed in part as Ford's chance to explain his decision to pardon Nixon. 

In March 1979, weeks before Ford's publisher *Harper & Row* planned to publish *A Time To Heal,* an undisclosed source provided The Nation Magazine with Ford's unpublished manuscript. 

Working directly from the bootleg copy of the pages, an editor of The Nation produced a short piece entitled “The Ford Memoirs-Behind the Nixon Pardon.” 

The Nation piece was timed to "scoop" an article scheduled shortly to appear in Time Magazine. Time had agreed to purchase the exclusive right to print prepublication excerpts from the copyright holders, Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. ("Harper"). When Time found out about The Nation article, Time canceled its agreement. 

Harper sued The Nation for copyright infringement and won. 

On appeal, the Second Circuit reversed the lower court's finding of infringement, holding that The Nation's act was sanctioned as a “fair use” of the copyrighted material. 

The Supreme Court reversed. Writing for the majority Justice Sandra Day O'Connor acknowledged that the Second Circuit was correct to note that Ford's book was "news" and mostly "facts," the kind of material that militates in favor of a fair use finding. But O'Connor placed greater emphasis on the author's publishing rights under &#167;106:

> The right of first publication implicates a threshold decision by the author whether and in what form to release his work. First publication is inherently different from other §106 rights in that only one person can be the first publisher; as the contract with Time illustrates, the commercial value of the right lies primarily in exclusivity. Because the potential damage to the author from judicially enforced “sharing” of the first publication right with unauthorized users of his manuscript is substantial, the balance of equities in evaluating such a claim of fair use inevitably shifts.

The Court applied the four prongs of the &#167;107 fair use as follows:

1. The purpose and character of the use:

The Court agreed with the Second Circuit that The Nation's purpose in publishing the excerpts was ostensibly "news reporting," and that §107 lists news reporting as one of the exemplary activities tending toward a finding of fair use. But the court insisted that the issue was not what constitutes "news," but whether a claim of newsreporting is a valid fair use defense to an infringement of *copyrightable expression*.”

As for the *character* of The Nation's use, the trial court found that The Nation knowingly exploited a purloined manuscript. The Supreme Court said that: "Fair use presupposes ‘good faith’ and ‘fair dealing,’” which was decidedly lacking in The Nation's conduct.

2. The nature of the copyrighted work:

The Court characterized "A Time to Heal" as an unpublished historical narrative or autobiography. The law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy, but the Court again stressed: "The fact that a work is unpublished is a critical element of its 'nature.'"

> The right of first publication encompasses not only the choice whether to publish at all, but also the choices of when, where, and in what form first to publish a work.

3. Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used. 

As the Court put it: 

> In absolute terms, the words actually quoted were an insubstantial portion of “A Time to Heal.” The District Court, however, found that “[T]he Nation took what was essentially the heart of the book.”

4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

The Court found that "this last factor is undoubtedly the single most important element of fair use." And The Nation's advanced publication of excerpts destroyed the market for first serial rights, because when Time Magazine learned of The Nation's publication it canceled the deal, and with good reason.
