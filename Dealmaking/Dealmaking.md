Dealmaking in the publishing industry has always been a civilized sport with just a few usually friendly players: author, agent and publisher. Even deals worth millions are relatively simple and sound, never mind that it was made over the phone weeks ago. The same is true in Hollywood, despite the occasional high-profile lawsuits, some of which we read. 

People in the entertainment industry do deals worth millions with phone calls, handshakes, napkin and iPad agreements. They haggle via texts and tweets and emails, until somebody says the magic words "we are closed" and everybody makes friendly noises. That means you have a deal, and 99% of the time you DO have a deal. The written parts of that deal might not come for months. But eventually people in business affairs cut, cull and paste those original messages into deal memos and letter agreements and proposed contract drafts that usually say, "these contract terms are void and unenforceable unless this agreement is signed by both parties," but those agreements sometimes never get signed; they just stand as some evidence of what the parties intended during negotiations. 

The entertainment industries are too fast moving and involve too many players and contingent deals to dawdle while lawyers fuss over contract language and wait for signatures. Usually the bargains struck work out fine. Blockbusters and tentpoles get made and the players compromise on any terms that weren't included in the conversations surrounding the original deal. 

When deals fall through, a judge or jury comes along and asks almost metaphysical questions about what happened: Did the parties agree? Or did they just agree to make an agreement later? After some uncertain event? Like, "Yes, we agree, but only if Spielberg directs and Daniel Craig plays the hero." A deal or a deal to make a deal if--? 

The book passages help give us a glimpse into deals in the various industries, but another way to appreciate the boundaries of the often hurry-scurry world of dealmaking is to read the cases memorializing some famous Hollywood and publishing feuds.
