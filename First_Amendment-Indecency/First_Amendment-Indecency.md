# Lawyers For The Talent

###### by Richard Dooling

## First Amendment - Indecency

Just as we get comfortable with the notion of categories, and the notion that speech is either protected or unprotected, along comes a category of speech the Federal Commmunications Commission wishes to REGULATE. 

Please read these two cases in their entirety. Keep your eye on the ball: Is George Carlin's speech protected speech? When Bono says, "This is really really fucking brilliant" during a prime time TV broadcast at the 2003 Golden Globe awards, is that obscene?
