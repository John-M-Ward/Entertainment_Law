###### Credits, Trademark, Moral Rights *Droit Morale*, Idea Protection

Here we deal with everything from artistic credits to moral rights to trademarks and so-called idea-protection strategies.

### Trademark

#### Lanham Act &sect; 43(a)

Trademarks are "brands" or "marks" associated with goods, services and commercial activities.

> Any person who . . . uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device . . . or any false designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact . . . which . . . is likely to cause confusion . . . mistake . . . or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship or approval of his or her goods, services or commercial activities . . .

##### *Lamothe v. Atlantic Recording Group* (9th Cir. 1988)

* [*Lamothe v. Atlantic Recording Group,*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=847+F.2d+1403&appflag=67.12) 847 F.2d 1403 (9th Cir. 1988).  

* Lamothe, Jones and Crosby had a band called Mac Meda and jointly authored two songs entitled "Scene of the Crime" and "I'm Insane." 
* The Mac Meda band broke up, and Crosby joined a band called RATT.
* Atlantic Records released an album by RATT, which included the two songs “Scene of the Crime” and "I'm Insane."
* The songs were attributed to Crosby and Croucier (another member of RATT).
* The other two members of Mac Meda, Lamothe and Jones, who had jointly authored "Scene of the Crime" and "I'm Insane" received no credit. 

Lamothe and Jones sued Crosby, Croucier and Atlantic under the Lanham Trademark Act, Section 43(a), which prohibits false designations and false representations likely to cause confusion about the origins of the songs.

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Lamothe and Jones:

> In the present case, the [musicians] clearly have a legitimate interest in protecting their work from being falsely designated as the creation of another.

> * [*Lamothe v. Atlantic Recording Group,*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=847+F.2d+1403&appflag=67.12) 847 F.2d 1403 (9th Cir. 1988). 
 
##### "Passing off," "Palming off," "Reverse passing off"
 
The Lanham Act, &sect; 43(a), prohibits false designations or representations of goods or services. 

If you take someone else's goods or services and pass them off as your own, it's a trademark violation. You put YOUR name on THEIR product and pass it off as your own. 

It's called "reverse passing off" if you remove someone's name from goods or services and then sell the product in an unbranded state or add false designations of origin.

This is what Crosby and Croucier did. They removed two artists names from the credits, gave Crosby credit, and falsely designated Croucier as an author. 

#### Trademark Cases

* [*Hormel Foods Corp. v. Jim Henson Productions*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=73f3d497&appflag=67.12), 73 F.3d 497 (2d Cir. 1996).

### Moral Rights

* [*Granz v.  Harris*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=198f2d585&appflag=67.12), 198 F.2d 585 (2d Cir. 1952).

* [Wikipedia: Moral Rights and Creator Control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights).

#### *Granz v. Harris,* (2d Cir. 1952).

* Norman Granz, well-known promoter and producer of jazz concerts, had one of his concerts recorded featuring two popular pieces titled "How High The Moon" and "Lady Be Good."
* Granz LICENSED Herbert Harris a record producer to manufacture and sell recordings WITH THE CREDIT LINE “Presented by Norman Granz.”
* Harris produced records, but he omitted 8 minutes of the original songs because the performances would not fit onto the 10-inch records Harris was using at the time.
* Granz sued Harris for breach of contract. 
* Not a copyright violation necessarily because Harris has a LICENSE.
* Do we need "moral rights" to protect Granz?
* Court says no. A contract will suffice.
* The contract conveying the license said that Harris could sell the recordings but only if he used the legend: “Presented by Norman Granz.”

The court said that the contract IMPLIED a duty not to sell records which would make the legend "Presented by Norman Granz" a false designation by cutting 8 minutes out of the session Granz presented.

> Sale of the ten-inch abbreviated records was a breach of the contract . . . and [because] the harm to the plaintiff's reputation as an expert in the presentation of jazz concerts is irreparable, injunctive relief is appropriate.

> * [*Granz v.  Harris*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=198f2d585&appflag=67.12), 198 F.2d 585 (2d Cir. 1952).

#### Scope of Rights

* [*Gilliam v.  ABC*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=538f2d14&appflag=67.12), 538 F.2d 14 (2d Cir. 1976). 
* [*Gilliam*/Monty Python case at Wikipedia.][monty_python_wikipedia]

The British comedy group Monty Python sued ABC for violating copyright and damaging their artistic reputations by broadcasting drastically edited versions of their shows. 

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that ABC had arguably engaged in "actionable mutilation" and banned further broadcasts by ABC. The Court said that the Lanham Act (Trademark) could provide protection in the United States similar to that provided by moral rights in Europe and that ABC had also probably infringed Monty Python's copyright. Monty Python's original license to the BBC did not include BBC's right to drastically edit the episodes, and BBC could convey no more rights to ABC than BBC owned.

### Idea Protection

If the screenwriter has not yet written the screenplay she has in mind, she is unable to rely on copyright law to protect her idea. But she wants to tell a producer about her idea in case the producer wants to hire her to write it. How can you prevent the producer from stealing the idea and developing it with someone else?

#### *Desny v.  Wilder,* (CA. 1956).

* [*Desny v.  Wilder,*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=46+Cal.2d+715&appflag=67.12) 46 Cal.2d 715 (CA. 1956).

* Writer Victor Desny called director-producer Billy Wilder to set up an appointment to meet Wilder and pitch his story idea for a movie.
* Wilder's secretary told Desny to write a synopsis describing the idea.
* Two days later, Desny called back and dictated the synopsis to the secretary.
* Desny told the secretary that he expected compensation if the idea was used, and she assured him that he would be paid if his idea were used. 

Wilder stole Desny's idea and made a movie called *Ace In The Hole*.

Desny sued and won because he made a deal that he would be paid if his idea were used. Otherwise, as the court observes, "ideas are as free as the air."

> * [*Desny v.  Wilder,*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=46+Cal.2d+715&appflag=67.12) 46 Cal.2d 715 (CA. 1956).

#### Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990 (VARA)

* [Wikipedia summary of VARA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Artists_Rights_Act).

Copyright aside, what are other property rights may be associated with works of art? What if I decide that almost nobody can afford a Picasso, so I buy one Picasso and cut it up into a thousand pieces so I can sell the pieces to interested parties. Can anybody stop me?  

##### Exclusive rights under VARA:

VARA grants the authors of certain works the following exclusive rights:

* right to claim authorship
* right to prevent the use of one's name on any work the author did not create
* right to prevent use of one's name on any work that has been distorted, mutilated, or modified in a way that would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation
* right to prevent distortion, mutilation, or modification that would prejudice the author's honor or reputation

Additionally, authors of works of "recognized stature" may prohibit intentional or grossly negligent destruction of a work. Exceptions to VARA require a waiver from the author in writing. To date, "recognized stature" has managed to elude a precise definition. VARA allows authors to waive their rights, something generally not permitted in France and many European countries whose laws were the originators of the moral rights of artists concept.

In most instances, the rights granted under VARA persist for the life of the author (or the last surviving author, for creators of joint works).

#### Covered works.

VARA provides its protection only to paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures, still photographic images produced for exhibition only, and existing in single copies or in limited editions of 200 or fewer copies, signed and numbered by the artist. The requirements for protection do not implicate aesthetic taste or value.
