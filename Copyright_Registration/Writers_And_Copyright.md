# Authors & Writers - Copyright Registration 

## I Disclaim

I am an author and sometimes a screenwriter. 
I'm also a lawyer, 
and I teach Entertainment Law at the University of Nebraska College of Law, 
but I am not YOUR lawyer, and the text you find here is NOT legal advice. 

To paraphrase Hunter Thompson: 

> The entertainment industry 
> is a cruel and shallow money trench &hellip; a long plastic 
> hallway where thieves and pimps run free 
> and good men die like dogs.

It's no place to be guessing about your legal rights. 
If you need legal advice, GET A LAWYER! 

## Are You An Author Or A Writer?

For convenience, 
let's call people who write and publish books AUTHORS. 
Let's call people who write "works for hire" WRITERS 
(screenwriters, journalists, composers of corporate newsletters, gag writers). 

Let's use those makeshift definitions 
to explore how the copyright laws treat authors and writers under copyright law.
Begin with copyright ownership and the all important question: Who owns the rights? 
The copyright laws put it this way: 

> COPYRIGHT OWNERSHIP ["vests initially in the author or authors of the work."][201] 

*Authors* own the copyright to the works they create, from the moment those works are created.
This makes sense. The author writes a poem; the author owns the copyright to the poem. 

If the author writes a poem *with* another author, they create a [joint work][201], 
and both authors are coowners of the copyright in the poem. 

Not so with writers (again using our definition as a writer of works made for hire).
If the writer is a hired gun paid to create a "work made for hire," 
the copyright laws say that 
["the employer or other person for whom the work was prepared"][201] 
is considered the author of the copyrighted work. 

Maybe Quentin Crisp was right, and 
"the law is simply expediency wearing a long white dress,"
because this makes sense too. 
The greeting card company who pays the writer to create poems 
to be printed on its greeding cards 
should own copyrights to the poems, 
unless the writer and the company have agreed otherwise in a signed writing.

In Hollywood, 
studios hire writers to create screenplays, 
with all parties knowing full well 
that the studios will own the rights. 
Writers are hired and fired 
until the script is just right. 
Yes, I am oversimplifying. 
The copyright statute's definition of a "work made for hire" is more elaborate, 
but for now assume that writers 
(using our working definition), 
especially paid screenwriters, 
create works made for hire, 
or works owned by somebody else.

So much for who owns the rights, 
but what is that they own?
 
What is copyright?



## Intellectual Property

Copyright is a form of "intellectual property," 
and the law often treats intellectual property 
just like "real property" or land. 

Amy Author owns a plot of land called The Hundred Acre Wood. 
Not being a lawyer, 
Amy tends to think of The Hundred Acre Wood 
as something she either owns or doesn't own. 
If she doesn't own it, maybe she rents it.  

Amy's lawyer is trained to think of The Hundred Acre Wood 
not just as a thing that Amy owns or doesn't own, 
but as a bundle of rights (similar to a bundle of sticks).
These rights are associated with The Hundred Acre Wood. 

Each stick in Amy's bundle is a land right 
that Amy can sell or lend to others, 
or she can sell them all at once to one person. 

Consider three simple hypothetical sticks or rights 
in Amy's Hundred-Acre-Wood bundle:

1. Amy rents ten acres of The Hundred Acre Wood to a farmer for two years; 
2. Amy sells the right to drill for natural gas beneath The Hundred Acre Wood to a fracking company; 
3. Amy sells "an easement" to a telecom company, 
so it can bring its trucks and equipment 
into The Hundred Acre Wood, 
bury a fiberoptic cable, and maintain it indefinitely.

Does Amy still own the Hundred Acre Wood? 
Of course, but now that she has sold certain rights to the land, 
ownership is more complicated. 

Does the farmer own The Hundred Acre Wood? 
No, but Amy has sold him *the right* to use ten acres of her land for two years. 
Do the fracking company and the telecom company *own* The Hundred Acre Wood? 
No, but again they have paid Amy for various *rights* to use or occupy her land. 

What if somebody wants to buy the Hundred Acre Wood,  
but they don't want frackers or fiberoptic cable workers on their land?
What sort of "license" did Amy give the frackers and the cable workers?

Is there a public record of Amy's land ownership? Yes. 
Anybody can do a title search at the register of deeds 
and see who owns The Hundred Acre Wood. 

## Intellectual Property

Now Amy builds a cabin deep in the Hundred Acre Wood, 
where she writes a novel called *Zombies & Vampires*. 

The Hundred Acre Wood is real property 
consisting of the land and a bundle of Amy's rights protected by property law. 
Amy's novel is "intellectual property" 
consisting of her writing and a bundle of rights protected by the U.S. copyright laws. 

The first copyright law was the Statute of Anne, 
passed in England in the year 1710. 

In 1790, the Framers of the U.S. Constitution had the same idea in mind when they drafted Article I, section 8, which says:  

> The Congress shall have power &hellip; To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.

The Consititution grants Congress many powers (to raise armies, to declare war, to coin money), but the only BUSINESS explicitly protected by the Constitution is the intellectual property business. Nice for authors, artists and inventors!

Congress wasted no time exercising its new power and passed the first U.S. copyright law in 1790. The last major overhaul of these laws was the Copyright Act of 1976. 

The copyright laws describe and protect the bundle of rights Amy owns novel *Aliens and Zombies and Zombies.* Consider just three simple hypothetical sticks or rights contained in the bundle of rights Amy owns.

1. Amy (via her literary agent) grants Random House the right to print and sell hardback copies of *Aliens, Zombies & Vampires* in English in North America in exchange for standard royalties of 15% and an advance against royalites of $50,000.
2. Amy (via her literary agent and a foreign sub-agent) grants the Japanese publisher Kodansha the right to print and sell paperback copies of *Aliens & Vampires* in Japanese in Japan in exchange for royalties amounting to 10% of the cover price and an advance of $15,000.
3. Amy (via her literary agent and her Hollywood sub agent) gives Pete Producer an option to develop the film rights of *Aliens, Zombies & Vampires* for 18 months in exchange for $20,000. o 

Does Amy still own the copyright to her novel *Zombies, Aliens & Vampires*? Yes. Does Random House own the copyright to Amy's novel? No, but Amy gave Random House a LICENSE to copy, print, and sell her books in English in North America. Likewise neither the Japanese publisher nor Pete Producer "own" the rights to Amy's novel, Amy has given them permission to exploit certain rights on her behalf.

## Who Owns The Rights?

Such are the perogatives of copyright OWNERSHIP. Novelists like Amy OWN and KEEP the rights to their creations and then (via agents and lawyers) LICENSE others to exploit certain rights in their intellectual property. 

As you probably realize by now, this is the biggest difference between authors and writers: Authors own the copyright intellectual property and license the rights to others. Writers are paid to create works, but their employers end up owning the copyright. 

the farmer own The Hundred Acre Wood? No, but Amy has sold him *the right* to use ten acres of her land for two years. Likewise, the fracking company and the telecom company don't own The Hundred Acre Wood, but again they have paid Amy for various *rights* to use or occupy her land. 

Now, let's describe three hypothetical sticks or rights contained in Amy's novel because of the copyright laws.

Hundred-Acre-Wood bundle:
Like real property, intellectual property consists of a bundle of sticks or rights in a tangible thing created by an author or inventor. As Frank Zappa once put it:  When artists, authors and inventors create or invent things, they have certain  

Copyright protection extends to “original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression.” [§ 102(a)](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102)

Even though it's called *intellectual* property it does not some might  



§ 201 . Ownership of copyright

(a) Initial Ownership. — Copyright in a	work protected under this title vests initially in the author or authors of the work. The authors of a joint work are coowners of copyright in the work.

(b) Works Made for Hire. — In the case of a work made for hire, the employer or other person for whom the work was prepared is considered the author for purposes of this title, and, unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise in a written instrument signed by them, owns all of the rights comprised in the copyright.

http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html#201

A “work made for hire” is— 

(1) a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment; or

(2) a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire. For the purpose of the foregoing sentence, a “supplementary work” is a work prepared for publication as a secondary adjunct to a work by another author for the purpose of introducing, concluding, illustrating, explaining, revising, commenting upon, or assisting in the use of the other work, such as forewords, afterwords, pictorial illustrations, maps, charts, tables, editorial notes, musical arrangements, answer material for tests, bibliographies, appendixes, and indexes, and an “instructional text” is a literary, pictorial, or graphic work prepared for publication and with the purpose of use in systematic instructional activities.

[yes, screenwriting actually is writing](http://johnaugust.com/2014/yes-screenwriting-is-actually-writing)

#### Why Register the Copyright?

Lawyer and programmer, [Ken Liu](http://kenliu.name/), has a great explanation at the Science Fiction and Fantasty Writers of America site.

> Do I have to register to get copyright protection?

> You do not. There was a time when registration made a difference in whether a work was protected by US copyright, but current law is explicit that “registration is not a condition of copyright protection.” [17 USC §408(a)](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#408). Copyright attaches as soon as “original works of authorship” are “fixed in any tangible medium of expression.” [17 USC §102(a)](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102). In other words, your words are copyrighted as soon as you write them down, whether they’re in a notebook, a Microsoft Word file, a blog post, a forum posting, or even a Facebook comment. Registration has nothing to do with it.

Many additional protections come with registration, but probably most important are the possibility of obtaining statutory damages and attorneys fees instead of having to prove actual damages:

> Normally, when someone infringes your copyright, you’re entitled only to “actual damages” and “profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement” [17 USC §504(b)](
http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#504). This can be a burden that makes pursuing a legal remedy not worthwhile: How do you prove the profits that some random web site made from publishing your story without permission? And how do you prove what sales you might have lost because of the web site’s unauthorized publication of your story? Since the US operates under the “American Rule” where each party pays their own lawyers, you might not even be able to afford to pay a lawyer to stop the infringing activity.

> But with timely registration, you get the option of electing statutory damages instead. [17 USC §504(c)](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#504). This can be between $750 to $30,000 per work (and up to $150,000 per work if the infringement was willful). Plus, you may get attorney’s fees and costs at the court’s discretion, making it more likely that you can retain a lawyer on a contingency fee basis. [17 USC §505](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#505). With these benefits, it may well make sense to pursue cases that otherwise you would not.

#### Screenplay Copyright Registration v. Writers Guild Registry

[Larry Zerner: Time For The Writers Guild To Shut Down The WGA Registry](http://zernerlaw.wordpress.com/2010/12/03/it%E2%80%99s-time-for-the-writer%E2%80%99s-guild-to-shut-down-the-wga-registry/)

[Larry Zerner: WGAw Registration vs. Copyright Registration]( http://www.writersstore.com/wgaw-registration-vs-copyright-registration/)

> §412 of the U.S. Copyright Act, in a lawsuit for copyright infringement, the Plaintiff cannot receive either attorney’s fees or statutory damages unless they registered with the Copyright Office before the infringement commences.[1]

> Judges interpreting §412 have interpreted "commencement" to mean the first act of infringement in a series of ongoing separate infringements. In the case of motion pictures, the first act of infringement would typically occur at the time a screenplay containing infringing material is written, *not the release of the movie.* This means that even if the aggrieved screenwriter finds out about the infringing movie and registers with the Copyright Office before the film’s release, it's almost certainly too late. Since the writer registered after commencement of the infringement, he or she could not receive statutory damages or attorney's fees in any subsequent litigation.

And from the Cornell site:

> However, &sect; 412 would deny any award of the special or "extraordinary" remedies of statutory damages or attorney's fees where infringement of copyright in an unpublished work began before registration or where, in the case of a published work, infringement commenced after publication and before registration (unless registration has been made within a grace period of three months after publication). These provisions would be applicable to works of foreign and domestic origin alike.

[Cornell Statutory History](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/412).

&sect; 412 of the Copyright Act denies statutory damages and attorney's fees if infringement of a copyright in an unpublished work began BEFORE the copyright was registered.

For copyrights in spec screenplays, three dates are crucial:

1. The date the copyright was registered.
2. The date of publication of the work. 
3. The date infringement commenced;

<http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#412>

§ 412 . Registration as prerequisite to certain remedies for infringement12

In any action under this title . . .  an action for infringement of the copyright of a work that has been preregistered under section 408(f) before the commencement of the infringement and that has an effective date of registration not later than the earlier of 3 months after the first publication of the work or 1 month after the copyright owner has learned of the infringement, or an action instituted under section 411(c), no award of statutory damages or of attorney’s fees, as provided by sections 504 and 505, shall be made for —

(1) any infringement of copyright in an unpublished work commenced before the effective date of its registration; or

(2) any infringement of copyright commenced after first publication of the work and before the effective date of its registration, unless such registration is made within three months after the first publication of the work.

I don't teach registration and damages etc. I have my hands full
teaching infringement and fair use in two weeks. But I always thought
you could register before commencing SUIT and get attys fees and
statutory damages?

This guy seems to be saying you must register before infringement occurs?

LOTS of writers use the WGA registry instead of registering copyright.

eek!

* If registration is made within three months after publication of
the work or prior to an infringement of the work, statutory damages
and attorney's fees will be available to the copyright owner in court
actions. Otherwise, only an award of actual damages and profits is
available to the copyright owner.

You have a three month grace period after publication to register; 

If you don't, you're barred from statutory damages and attorneys fees for any infringement that commenced before you registered.  

The writers that you're worried about are probably still okay since registration with the WGA wouldn't itself be a publication that starts the three month clock running.

Yes, but if you register your script with the WGA, then submit it to
your agent, who then shows it to producers. And then one of those
producers hires another writer to make a substantially similar work,
which comes out two years later, and then you hear about it, realize
that it's your script/idea, etc. THEN register with copyright office.
You are too late?

I guess the pivotal question becomes what's publication? For a
screenplay I'm guessing it's submission to
producers/directors/studios?

Probably still okay. Publication means a distribution to the public, and also presumably must occur with the consent of the copyright owner.

There's another wrinkle that you need to consider re attorney's fees and statutory damages.  Under sec  412, 

neither is available for infringement of unregistered unpublished works.  

So there IS an incentive to register if there is a chance that people will commence an infringement before the work is publically distributed.

On the other hand, you could simply e-publish via Amazon or iBooks it
as soon as you learned of the infringement, and then you get three
months to register the copyright AND are entitled to statutory dmx and
atty fees?

Robert Denicola <denicola@unl.edu>	Thu, Feb 6, 2014 at 11:40 AM
To: Richard Dooling <richarddooling@gmail.com>

No, because it's THE DATE THAT INFRINGEMENT COMMENCES, not when you learn of it that matters. So if infringement has commenced while it was still unpublished, you don't have the three-month grace period.

28-Jul-2014 - this is the CRUCIAL difference. If a book author circulated an mss and somebody stole it and infringed. The book author could simply PUBLISH the book and then get the three month

No the same would apply. It's just that it's more likely that somebody will steal it in Hollywood.

<!--Zerner correspondence-->

Larry,

I'm a bit of a hack screenwriter myself with just enough credits to
get work occasionally. I teach Entertainment Law at Univ of Nebraska
for a day job, so I do copyright in like 2 weeks each year, mainly
infringement and fair use.

I'm fascinated by your analysis of WGA registration vs. Copyright
registration which John August linked to the other day:

http://zernerlaw.wordpress.com/2010/12/03/it%E2%80%99s-time-for-the-writer%E2%80%99s-guild-to-shut-down-the-wga-registry/

Question: When is a screenplay "published" for purposes of &sect;
412? If it is circulated to agents and producers? Only if it gets
"made"?

Thanks. This is very interesting to me as I usually just upload at WGA
and figure I'll register if infringement ever happens. This could
change everything and could also force me to make room for
registration in my 2-3 weeks of copyright coverage.

THANKS

Richard Dooling

Richard,

Thanks for writing.  I'm glad you enjoyed the article.  It's really been of
mission of mine to educate writers about the importance of copyright
registration.  Mostly because I see so much money being lost because writers
can't get their attorney's fees in a copyright infringement lawsuit since
they only registered at WGA.

In answer to your question, I do not believe, and I am not aware of any case
that holds that when a screenwriter circulates his script to agents and
producers it has been "published." The Copyright Act says that, "The
offering to distribute copies to a group of persons for purposes of further
distribution, public performance, or public display, constitutes
publication."  However, when someone sends a screenplay out, they are really
not seeking further distribution, they are seeking someone who will agree to
turn the screenplay into a movie.

I don't think anyone has litigated the question, but in terms of copyright
damages, assuming that giving the script to an agent constituted
publication, that would only give the writer an additional 90 day window in
which to register.  If that happened, they would still be okay because
registration would have occurred prior to the infringement. The problem is
that in most of these cases, the writer doesn't know about the infringement
until the movie is about to be released, and at that point it's too late to
register and recover attorney's fees and statutory damages.

I don't know that you need to expand your entire class based on this
information.  But if you are training future entertainment lawyers, you
should at least mention the importance of registration with regard to
damages.  And not just for screenplays.  I do a number of cases for
photographers and in those cases, registration is essential to make the case
financially viable.

All the best,

Larry

Because Amy owns and keeps the rights to her novel Under [section 106](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106) of the copyright act, she "has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following":

> 2. to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work; 
> 3. to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;
> 4. in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the copyrighted work publicly;
> 5. in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work publicly; and

#### Work Made For Hire

A "work made for hire" is— 

(1) a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment; or

(2) a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire.
