###### Appropriation/Celebrity/Publicity Rights

> One who appropriates to his own use or benefit the name or likeness of another is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy.

The right of publicity, also known by far too many other names (personality rights, celebrity rights, publicity rights, appropriation of name or likeness), is the right of an individual to control the commercial use of his or her name, image, likeness, or other unequivocal aspects of one's identity. It is generally considered a property right as opposed to a personal right, and as such, the validity of the right of publicity can survive the death of the individual (to varying degrees depending on the jurisdiction).

Personality rights are generally considered to consist of two types of rights: 

1. The right of publicity, or to keep one's image and likeness from being commercially exploited without permission or contractual compensation, which is similar to the use of a trademark; 
2. The right to privacy, or the right to be left alone and not have one's personality represented publicly without permission. 

In common law jurisdictions, publicity rights fall into the realm of the tort of passing off. United States jurisprudence has substantially extended this right.

A commonly cited justification for this doctrine, from a policy standpoint, is the notion of natural rights and the idea that every individual should have a right to control how, if at all, his or her "persona" is commercialized by third parties. Usually, the motivation to engage in such commercialization is to help propel sales or visibility for a product or service, which usually amounts to some form of commercial speech (which in turn receives the lowest level of judicial scrutiny).

### Early "right of publicity" cases 

Early right of publicity cases followed the lead of the Brandeis "Right Of Privacy" article, which spoke of compensating "injury to the feelings."[^1] In *Roberson v. Rochester Folding Box Company,* (NY 1902), Abigail Roberson’s picture was reproduced on 25,000 copies of a poster advertising flour without her knowledge. She sued, but lost her case when the New York court ruled that there was no law of privacy. The case generated such public outrage that the New York legislature passed the first statutory law of privacy making it illegal to use one’s name or likeness for advertising or trade purposes without consent.

In *Pavesich v. New England Mutual Life Insurance,* (GA 1905), Atlanta artist Paolo Pavesich sued when his photo was used in a newspaper ad representing a prosperous, happy, contented person with insurance opposite a photo of a thin, haggard looking man who had not bought insurance. Georgia became the first state to recognize the right of privacy in common law when they awarded Pavesich $25,000 in personal damages due to the invasion.

Eventually, this "likeness" branch of the "right of privacy" was refined. The notion of "hurt feelings" caused by gossip or intrusive technology persisted in other branches of the privacy tort (intrusion, false light, publication of private facts), but the right of publicity took a different turn. An individual's name, image, and likeness became a species of property to be licensed.
