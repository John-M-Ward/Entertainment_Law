## Lawyers For The Talent

###### By Richard Dooling

I teach Entertainment Law at the University of Nebraska College of Law. I also teach an undergraduate course at the University, which might be called Entertainment Law for Artists.

This is a public repository of the files I use to teach Entertainment Law. Since it's open to all, please read the following:

### THE USUAL DISCLAIMERS

Yes, I am a lawyer, and yes I teach Entertainment Law, but I am not YOUR lawyer and the text you find in these files is NOT legal advice. To paraphrase Hunter Thompson, the entertainment industry is a "cruel and shallow money trench . . . a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free and good men die like dogs." It's no place to be guessing about your legal rights. If you need legal advice, GET A LAWYER! 

These materials are published under an [MIT license](https://github.com/RichardDooling/Entertainment_Law/blob/master/LICENSE).

### Open Source Scholarship

If all goes well, the files in this GitHub repository will grow into an open source Entertainment Law textbook. I hope to entice collaborators: students, former students, entertainment lawyers, artists, and other professors, who may find these materials useful and help me improve them. (At the moment, I am especially interested in a collaborator or contributor with experience working in the music industry.) 

Whenever possible, I link to free content, including Wikipedia, YouTube, [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/), the [SCOTUS blog](http://www.scotusblog.com/), and other notable resources that are not behind paywalls. For the convenience of law students with Westlaw accounts, I often provide links to cases on Westlaw, but whenever possible I also provide a link to the same case on [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/), or to the opinion itself as published by the court.

### Files & Folders

Each folder contains one Markdown file (.md) named after the folder. For instance, the Introduction folder contains a Markdown file called Introduction.md. These Markdown files are the source files for the text you see on the screen when you view them. I also make this content available to my students as Word files (.docx) and as PDFs.

You don't need to know Markdown or computer programming to use or view these files. Public repositories (like this one) can be browsed and the files can be downloaded by anyone. If you are a student looking to download or view the Entertainment Law files, you may stop here.

However, if you are willing to spend a little time learning how Git and GitHub work, you will be able to quickly fetch the latest versions of these files to your computer using a simple free application available at [GitHub](https://github.com/).
