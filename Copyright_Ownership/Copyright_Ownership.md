### Digital Sampling and Imaging

#### Works For Hire

#### Joint Authorship 

The copyright statute defines a "joint work" as:

> a work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole.

To be considered joint authors, each author must:

1. Contribute *copyrightable* elements to the joint work, and
2. At the time the work was created, intend to merge their own contributions with the contributions of coauthors to form a unified whole. 

These rules govern WHO OWNS THE COPYRIGHT. The parties are free to adjust ownership by making deals for partial ownership of the copyright. 

> [T]he person with noncopyrightable material who proposes to join forces with a skilled writer to produce a copyrightable work is free to make a contract to disclose his or her material in return for assignment of part ownership of the resulting copyright.

> *Childress v. Taylor*, (2nd Cir. 1991)

##### *Childress v. Taylor,* (2nd Cir. 1991). 

* Clarice Taylor, an actress, wanted to develop a play about the life of ["Moms" Mabley,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moms_Mabley) an African-American vaudeville comedienne.   
* Taylor began to collect material about “Moms” Mabley, interviewing Mabley's friends and family, collecting her jokes, and reviewing library resources.
* In 1985, Taylor contacted Alice Childress, a professional playwright who had won an [“Obie” award](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obie_Award) for her work and whose plays Taylor had acted in since the 1940s.
* Taylor wanted to hire Childress to write the play about "Moms," and Childress eventually agreed.
* Taylor turned over all of her research material to Childress, and later did further research at Childress's request. Taylor also paid Childress $2,500 as a down payment of sorts.
* Taylor does NOT dispute that Childress wrote the play entitled "Moms: A Praise Play for a Black Comedienne." 
* Taylor argues however that she provided more that mere research to the project: 
    * Taylor sifted facts and helped select key pivotal elements to include in the play about “Moms.” 
    * Taylor also discussed general scenes and characters with Childress and whether they should be included in the play. Childress and Taylor spoke on a regular basis about the progress of the play.
* Childress registered copyright in the play, and the two eventually had a falling out. The question became: **Who owned the copyright in the work?** Childress alone? Or, as Taylor argued, Childress and Taylor jointly?
* The court rejected Taylor's claim of joint authorship holding that a work qualifies as a “joint work” under the definition section of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 only when **both authors intended, at the time the work was created, “that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole,”** and there was not enough evidence that Childress had such an intent at the time she wrote "Moms."
* The Court said that copyright law requires that **the contributions of both authors to be independently copyrightable**, and that Taylor's contributions, which consisted of ideas and research, were NOT copyrightable.
* Also no evidence that Taylor's role ever evolved beyond helpful advice that might come from the cast, the directors, or the producers of any play. 
* The court said: “A playwright does not so easily acquire a co-author.”

> * [*Childress v.  Taylor,*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=945f2d500&appflag=67.12) 945 F.2d 500 (2nd Cir. 1991). 

### Licensing: The two "Cohen" Cases:

Courts often must apply old contract language to new technologies, especially when a person with a license to publish or exhibit existing works of film, music, or text now wants to publish or exhibit them in a brand new medium. 

Suppose an author licenses a publisher to print her books in hardcover or paperback. Does that license also include the right to publish the same book as an e-book? What if e-books did not even exist when the author made the publishing deal?

#### *Cohen dba Bizarre Music v. Paramount Pictures Corp.* (9th Cir. 1988):

* In 1969, Herbert Cohen owned copyright in a song called “Merry-Go-Round.”
* Cohen granted a “synchronization” license which gave Paramount the right to use the song "Merry-Go-Round" in a film called *Medium Cool.* 
* The license also gave Paramount the right to exhibit the movie "by means of television, including pay television, subscription television, and closed circuit into homes television."
* Over a decade later, in the 1980s, Paramount made the film *Medium Cool* available on videocassettes and sold around 3,000 copies, receiving gross revenue of $70,000 or so.  
* Cohen sued for copyright violation and won. A license conferring the right to exhibit a film "by means of television" DOES NOT include the right to distribute videocassettes of the film.
* The license Cohen granted held back "all rights and uses in and to said musical composition, except those herein granted to the licensee . . ." This language limited uses to those known or contemplated by the parties. 
* When Cohen signed the deal in 1969, videocassette recorders (VCRs) had not been invented yet, so Cohen could not have known he was selling the right to display a movie using his song on videocassette. 
* The court compared the terms of Cohen's license to similar agreements in two other other videocassette cases:
    - A contract between Platinum Record and LucasFilm giving the right “to exhibit, distribute, exploit, market and perform said motion picture, its air, screen and television trailers, **perpetually throughout the world by any means or methods now or hereafter known**,” included the right to make the work available on videocassette.
    - The same was true of a contract in *Rooney v. Columbia Pictures* (SDNY 1982) which licensed the right to exhibit the films “**by any present or future methods or means**” and by “**any other means now known or unknown**.”

#### *Effects Associates v. Cohen,* (9th Cir. 1990) 

* Low-budget horror movie mogul Larry Cohen made a movie called *The Stuff* about a yogurt-like alien life form invading earth.
* Cohen hired Effects Associates to make some special effects for the movie, including video showing the climactic explosion of a factory where The Stuff was mass-produced.
* Cohen orally promised to pay Effects Associates roughly $64,000 for creating the special effects. No written agreement and no discussion about who would own the copyright to the special effects footage.
* Effects Associates delivered the special effects as promised, but Cohen was unhappy about the factory explosion, and so paid only half of the promised amount for that sequence, for a total of $56,000.
* Effects Associates made several demands for the rest of the agreed sum (a little over $8,000), but Cohen refused to pay. 
* Cohen went ahead and used the footage (including the factory explosion sequence) in the film, and turned *The Stuff* over to New World Entertainment for distribution. 
* Effects Associates sued for copyright infringement, claiming that Cohen (along with his production company and New World) had no right to use the special effects footage unless Cohen paid Effects Associates the full contract price. 
* The court ruled that Effects Associates had not transfered copyright in the special effects footage because transfers of copyright must be **IN WRITING.**
* Cohen argued that regardless of what the copyright statute says, the industry standard in the movie business was to have oral agreements. "
* Moviemakers do lunch, not contracts, Cohen argued. Moviemakers are too absorbed in developing “joint creative endeavors” to “focus upon the legal niceties of copyright licenses."
* The Court disagreed with this notion, but noted that **nonexclusive licenses** need not be in writing and may be implied by the behavior of the parties.
* The Court found that since Effects made the footage to Cohen's specifications and gave it to him, there was an implied license for Cohen to use it. 
* The court called copyright ownership "a bundle of rights":

> In granting a nonexclusive license to Cohen, Effects has given up only one stick from that bundle—the right to sue Cohen for copyright infringement. It retains the right to sue him in state court on a variety of other grounds, including breach of contract. Additionally, Effects may license, sell or give away for nothing its remaining rights in the special effects footage.
