## Copyright Basics

### History of Copyright

> "Copyright turns the content of protected works into a private good whose authors can grant or withhold consent to others to use and distribute it." ---Paul Weiler, *Entertainment, Media and The Law*

The constitution gives Congress the power, under Article I, Section 8, Clause 8:

> To promote the progress of Science and useful Arts by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.

And Congress has passed laws (copyright, trademark, patent) in an attempt to do achieve these ends. 

We do not have time to explore the particulars of [copyright terms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_term) or (the length of time copyright protects a work before it passes into the public domain). In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. [List of countries' copyright lengths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries%27_copyright_length).

For our purposes, the shortest and most entertaining introduction to copyright terms in the United States is CGP Grey's YouTube presentation: [Forever Less One Day: Meet Copyright!][4ever-1day]. It bears rewatching.

#### Rights Protected Include:

* Production of the initial work
* Production of derivative works
* Distribution of the product by sale or rental
* Public performance
* Public display

Running theme: Artists invest time, talent, and money to produce art for consumers *economic* rights are what make possible the investment of time, talent, and money that ultimately produces a work for entertainment consumers to enjoy.

Copyright strives to strike a delicate balance between intellectual property rights and free speech rights.

#### Copyrightable Works

What is copyrightable?

Copyright protection extends to “original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression.” [§ 102(a)](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102)

All works? Or only "artistic works"? What about "bad" art? What an adver few sketches of circus to be used in an advertisement for a circus? Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes addressed the question in 1903.

##### *Bleistein v Donaldson Lithographing Co.,* (Sct. 1903)

George Bleistein was an artist hired by a circus promoter to design and produce lithographs of dancers and acrobats to be used as advertisements for the circus. When the circus promoter ran out of prints, instead of ordering more from Bleistein, the promoter hired the Donaldson Lithographing company to make copies of the posters.

When Bleistein the sketch artist sued, a lower court dismissed his case holding that the prints were just sketches and had "no other use than as a pure advertisement" and had no "connection with the fine arts to give (them) intrinsic value."

[The Supreme Court reversed,][bleistein] and Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the opinion:

> It would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations, outside of the narrowest and most obvious limits.

In other words, sketches must be *original,* but otherwise the Constitution and Copyright Statute impose no requirement of aesthetic quality in an intellectual product to merit copyright protection.

#### Copyright Protects "Original Works of Authorship"

"Originality" requires independent creation of new intellectual products, something that is intrinsically different from research and discovery of already-existing facts. [*Feist Publications v Rural Telephone Service*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_v._Rural)

Copyright protection extends only to an author's expression of facts and not to the facts themselves. 

> The discoverer merely finds and records. He may not claim that the
facts are 'original' with him although there may be originality and
hence authorship in the manner of reporting, i.e., the "expression," of
the facts.

> The valuable distinction in copyright law between facts and the
expression of facts cannot be maintained if research is held to be
copyrightable.

> *Nimmer on Copyright*

#### Enough Original Content to Constitute "a Work"

How much content do you need? Not much. The test is easy to meet, but really there is no test. The copyright registrar and the courts look at each borderline case based on its own facts.

In 1987, Atari games wanted to register the video game *Breakout,* which consisted of little more than a flat image of a paddle and basic colored geometric shapes on a screen. At first the Copyright Registrar Ralph Oman refused to register the work because it "did not contain at least a minimum amount of original pictorial or graphic authorship, or authorship in sounds". [Atari challenged Oman's refusal to award the game copyright protection.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Games_Corp._v._Oman) and won. The appellate court said:

For a work to be Copyrightable, it must be fixed. It also must possess a certain low level of creativity which courts have described as "very slight," "minimal," "modest." 

In [*Feist v. Rural*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_v._Rural) the Supreme Court said that "the requisite level of creativity is extremely low; even a slight amount will suffice." 

Because *Breakout* consisted of a series of shapes and images in a particular sequence alongside audio, the Court found it met the requisite level of Copyright.  

Even five distinctive musical notes are copyrightable. Watch this video clip from [*Close Encounters Of The Third Kind*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYCBgSRNjk0). Beginning at the 5:00 mark, the five second tones played to make contact with the alien ship were created by famed movie composer John Williams and a copyright successfully registered to protect them.
  
#### Fixation

Copyright protection does not require a work to be published, but does require that the work be "fixed in a tangible medium of expression" [&sect; 102(a)][102]  

> A work is 'fixed' . . . when its embodiment in a copy or phonorecord .  . . is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration. [&sect; 101][101]

##### *Horgan v Macmillan,* (2d Cir. 1986)

The choreographer of *The Nutcracker* sued to enjoin publication of a book which portrayed in text and photos how the ballet was presented in New York. The book consisted of 60 photos, with narration describing the action, including scenes not pictured.

The trial court refused to stop publication of the book because “still photos cannot infringe choreography.” 

On appeal, the 2nd Circuit reversed, saying that taking small but qualitatively
significant amounts of the original work violates copyright law even if viewers of the latter can't use these excerpts to recreate the full original. 

The case settled before trial.

### What Doesn't Copyright Protect?

#### Ideas

The copyright laws DO NOT protect IDEAS. [§ 102(b)](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102)  Only the *expression of an idea* is protected, and even then what's protected is the EXPRESSION, not the IDEA expressed.

#### Research

The copyright laws do not protect research. 

##### *Miller v. Universal Studios, Inc.,* 

*   [*Miller v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,*](http://lawschool.westlaw.com/shared/westlawRedirect.aspx?task=find&cite=650f2d1365&appflag=67.12) 650 F.2d 1365 (5th Cir. 1981).  [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_v._Universal_City_Studios,_Inc.).

> In December 1968 the college-aged daughter of a wealthy Florida land developer was abducted from an Atlanta motel room and buried alive in a plywood and fiberglass capsule. A crude life-support system kept her alive for the five days she was underground before her rescue. Gene Miller, a reporter for the Miami Herald, covered the story and subsequently collaborated with the victim to write a book about the crime. Published in 1971 under the title *83 Hours Till Dawn*, the book was copyrighted along with a condensed version in Reader's Digest and a serialization in the Ladies Home Journal. 

> In January 1972 a Universal City Studios (Universal) producer read the condensed version of the book and thought the story would make a good television movie. He gave a copy of the book to a scriptwriter, who immediately began work on a screenplay. Although negotiations for purchase of the movie rights to 83 Hours Till Dawn were undertaken by Universal, no agreement with Miller was ever reached. The scriptwriter was eventually advised that use of the book in completing the script was “verboten.” The movie was completed, however, and aired as an ABC Movie of the Week, The Longest Night.

> The evidence at trial was conflicting on whether the scriptwriter relied almost entirely on the book in writing the screenplay or whether he arrived at his version of the kidnapping story independently. Both plaintiff and his expert witness testified to numerous similarities between the works. The jury, which had copies of the book and viewed the movie twice during the trial, found the movie infringed Miller's copyright and awarded him over $200,000 in damages and profits.

> The most substantial question presented on appeal is whether the district court erred in instructing the jury that “research is copyrightable.” Because the Court finds reversible error in this regard, other issues raised on this appeal will be discussed only as necessary to avoid further confusion on retrial.

Notable quotations from the Second Circuit's opinion:

> It is well settled that copyright protection extends only to an author's expression of facts and not to the facts themselves.

Quoting its opinion in *Hoehling v. Universal City* (2d Cir. 1980), the Second Circuit observed:

> “the cause of knowledge is best served when history is the common property of all, and each generation remains free to draw upon the discoveries and insights of the past.” 

#### Sc&#232;nes-&#192;-Faire

Definition: [Sc&#232;nes-&#192;-Faire at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sc%C3%A8nes_%C3%A0_faire) 

> Incidents, characters, or settings which are as a practical matter indispensable, or at least standard, in the treatment of a given topic.

Copyright protects "original works of art." Chances are your story about a greedy miser, cruel slave master, or romantic comedy in which your main characters start out hating each other and then fall and love and live happily ever contain copyrightable elements, but these clich&#233; elements or sc&#232;nes-&#224;-faire are not copyrightable. Maybe the first person who wrote a story about a pirate who said, "Arrrgh!" and had an eyepatch, bandana, and hook for a hand could at least argue for copyright protection, these elements are no longer copyrightable. Why? Because they are not ORIGINAL. 

#### Names, Titles, Short Phrases, Expressions

> Copyright law does not protect names, titles, or short phrases or expressions. Even 
if a name, title, or short phrase is novel or distinctive or lends itself to a play on 
words, it cannot be protected by copyright. The Copyright Office cannot register 
claims to exclusive rights in brief combinations of words such as:

>  * Names of products or services;
>  * Names of businesses, organizations, or groups (including the names of performing groups);
>  * Pseudonyms of individuals (including pen or stage names);
>  * Titles of works 
>  * Catchwords, catchphrases, mottoes,	slogans, or short advertising expressions 
>  * Listings of ingredients, as in recipes, labels, or formulas. When	a recipe or formula is accompanied by an explanation or directions, the text directions may be copyrightable, but the recipe or formula itself remains uncopyrightable.  

> [Circular 34: Copyright Protection Not Available for Names, Titles, or Short Phrases](
http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ34.pdf)

#### Characters

Could you write your own novel about a young magician called Harry Potter? Of course not, but you could write a novel about another young magician and make it original enough to avoid copyright problems.

* [Protecting Fictional Characters: Could You Legally Write A New Harry Potter Novel?](http://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverherzfeld/2012/11/08/protecting-fictional-characters-could-you-legally-write-a-new-harry-potter-novel/)

Long story short, literary characters are generally not copyrightable - "It is conceivable that the character really constitutes the story being told, but if the character is only the chessman in the game of telling the story he is not within the area of the protection afforded by the
copyright . . ." - *Warner Bros. v CBS* (9th Cir. 1954)

Cartoon Characters are copyrightable - [*Disney v Air Pirates*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Pirates) (9th Cir. 1978) - cartoons have a visual image rather than just a conceptual quality.

#### Why Register the Copyright?

Lawyer and programmer, [Ken Liu](http://kenliu.name/), has a great explanation at the Science Fiction and Fantasty Writers of America site.

> Do I have to register to get copyright protection?

> You do not. There was a time when registration made a difference in whether a work was protected by US copyright, but current law is explicit that "registration is not a condition of copyright protection." [17 USC §408(a)](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#408). Copyright attaches as soon as “original works of authorship” are "fixed in any tangible medium of expression." [17 USC §102(a)](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102). In other words, your words are copyrighted as soon as you write them down, whether they’re in a notebook, a Microsoft Word file, a blog post, a forum posting, or even a Facebook comment. Registration has nothing to do with it.

Many additional protections come with registration, but probably most important are the possibility of obtaining statutory damages and attorneys fees instead of having to prove actual damages:

> Normally, when someone infringes your copyright, you’re entitled only to "actual damages" and "profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement" [17 USC §504(b)](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#504). This can be a burden that makes pursuing a legal remedy not worthwhile: How do you prove the profits that some random web site made from publishing your story without permission? And how do you prove what sales you might have lost because of the web site’s unauthorized publication of your story? Since the US operates under the “American Rule” where each party pays their own lawyers, you might not even be able to afford to pay a lawyer to stop the infringing activity.

> But with timely registration, you get the option of electing statutory damages instead. [17 USC §504(c)](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#504). This can be between $750 to $30,000 per work (and up to $150,000 per work if the infringement was willful). Plus, you may get attorney’s fees and costs at the court’s discretion, making it more likely that you can retain a lawyer on a contingency fee basis. [17 USC §505](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#505). With these benefits, it may well make sense to pursue cases that otherwise you would not.
